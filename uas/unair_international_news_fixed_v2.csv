University World News,Research integrity risk index flags a dozen universities,Title,"INDONESIA Research integrity risk index flags a dozen universities Kafil Yamin 22 July 2025 Tweet A new research integrity risk index, which listed several of the country’s top universities as being at ‘high risk’ of systemic breaches of research integrity, has sparked a warning to universities from Indonesia’s Ministry of Higher Education and Science, calling on them to step up research integrity and improve research quality. More than a dozen highly regarded universities in Indonesia have been listed as being ‘high risk’ for research integrity. Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR), Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Universitas Sebelas Maret, and Universitas Hasanuddin (UNHAS) are in the ‘Red Zone’ of the new Research Integrity Risk Index (RI²) , released earlier this month by Professor Lokman Meho of the American University of Beirut. According to the RI² website, the ‘Red Zone’ flags up “extreme anomalies; systemic integrity risk”. Universitas Diponegoro (UNDIP), Universitas Padjadjaran (UNPAD), and Universitas Brawijaya (UNIBRAW) are in the ‘Orange’ or ‘High-Risk Zone’, implying “significant deviation from global norms”. RI² is the world’s first empirically grounded, composite metric designed to identify and profile institutional-level risks to research integrity. Described by Meho as “diagnostic in nature, not punitive”, the RI² rating of 1,500 global universities is based on their level of institutional risk in research integrity. Institutions were evaluated based on the number of retracted articles per thousand publications, capturing evidence of serious methodological, ethical, or authorship violations, as well as the percentage of an institution’s publications appearing in journals that were recently removed from Scopus or Web of Science for failing to meet quality or publishing standards. These indicators place each institution into one of five risk tiers (from ‘Red Flag’ to ‘Low Risk’) based on a fixed reference group of the 1,000 most publishing universities worldwide. University of Indonesia (UI), Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November (ITS), Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB), and Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) are in the list’s Yellow Zone, signalling “moderately elevated risk and emerging concern”. Kurniasih Mufidayati, deputy chair of Commission IX in the House of Representatives – mainly relating to education and youth matters – said the Research Integrity Risk Index report that places 13 Indonesian universities under the integrity risk spotlight should be a wake-up call to “straighten out” the country’s research environment. “Building a true academic culture will give a boost to university reputation and the quality of graduates,” she added. Ministry reaction In response to the rating, Indonesia’s Acting Secretary General of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology, Togar Simatupang, called on universities not to merely pursue quantity of journal publications, but quality. “The RI² research outcome is supposed to be taken positively as a reminder of Indonesian universities’ commitment to academic integrity,” Togas was quoted by the Antara news agency as saying on 18 July. acknowledged in a statement to local media that “research practices in Indonesia are still in the early stages of development, even at leading and top-tier universities,” and added that intensive efforts were needed not just at the policy level but also by universities, who should “address warning signs of serious problems or unhealthy behaviour in research integrity.” Kurniasih also urged Indonesian universities to build an academic culture that upholds honesty and integrity. Kurniasih believes Indonesia’s current research policies and higher education system emphasise the number of journal publications above quality so that academics can gain academic titles and enhance their reputation while ignoring ethics and values. “Lecturers and the universities they work for are more motivated to achieve a high number of publications by any means that often breaches academic ethics,” she told the media in Jakarta on Monday. Already pursuing research integrity Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR), listed in the ‘Red Zone’, said it has already been pushing for ethical and quality research, including the adoption of a standardised ethics protocol for publication. “We have developed handbooks on publication ethics and hold regular workshops and mentoring to implement them in our research,” Hery Purnobasuki, chairperson of the UNAIR’s Institute for Innovation, told University World News . The weekly UNAIR Menulis (UNAIR Writing) programme has become a vital platform for researchers to target reputable journals, avoid predatory outlets, and prevent researchers from problematic publications, he said. Since 2017, UNAIR has undergone a substantial shift in its scientific publication strategy – from a focus on quantity to prioritising quality. By 2025, more than 45% of its publications appeared in top-tier journals (Q1-Q2), while 72% were published in top 75% journals (Q1-Q3). Notably, 23.9% of these were in Q1 journals (top 25%), showing steady year-on-year growth, according to Purnobasuki. “To reduce reliance on foreign journals, UNAIR has also established and manages 20 Scopus-indexed journals spanning quartiles Q1 (top 25%) through Q4 (bottom 25%), Purnobasuki said, referring to a method of ranking Scopus journals based on research findings, citations, and industry value. “We’re not just productive – we’re making an impact. To date, over 22,751 UNAIR papers are indexed in Scopus,” he added. Lack of verification He regards the RI² findings as an external evaluation but notes a lack of verification with the universities concerned. “Such external evaluations should be confirmed with data and information on what we have been doing. “We acknowledge the data exists, but the figures cited are significantly exaggerated and do not match our internal records,” he maintained, pointing out “while the report mentioned 5,000 problematic articles, we have only identified around 2,000,” he said. The Forum for Indonesian Rectors (FRI) questioned the authority of the index, saying research institutions should be accredited by an international agency, which sets specific standards. “Without accreditation and scientific recognition, such research can be used to bring down the reputation of certain universities and bring up certain others. I hope the (academic) community does not easily take such research for granted,” FRI chairperson Didin Muhafidin told University World News . He fears such research could be aimed at downgrading some universities in order to attract students to the universities that perform better on RI². “The fact is that many universities overseas are short of students. Such research will encourage students to pursue studies overseas,” he added. He also called for further clarity. “The so-called integrity risk should be explained clearly. For example, (whether it is flagging) plagiarism or similar.” Pressure on Academics However, some academics see RI² reflecting the reality of Indonesia’s higher education. Danu Riyanto, a senior lecturer in ocean engineering at the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (ITS), said the main problem was the unrealistic targets imposed on academics. “Lecturers face pressures and expectations for high research output in reputable indexed journals within tight deadlines with low funding,” Riyanto said. He pointed at the BKD – the Indonesian acronym for Lecturer Workload – that demands every academic to be good at everything: from teaching to research to community service. “Faculties are burdened with accreditation reports, endless forms, and clerical duties that detract from actual teaching and research. Even when we have a grant, it is harder to write the budget report than the actual research reporting. “So, the problem is systemic, not (about) individual organisations,” he said.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20250722120756481

University World News,University impact rankings expand but remain volatile,18 June 2025,"GLOBAL University impact rankings expand but remain volatile Angel Calderon 18 June 2025 Tweet Times Higher Education (THE) released the seventh edition of its Impact Rankings (IR) on 18 June. Designed to showcase how institutions are working towards addressing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, this year’s edition is the biggest yet and one that is likely to be widely discussed because of its continued volatility and the need to address several shortcomings. This volatility is driven by an exponential increase in the number of participating institutions; amended guidance from THE limiting the assessable evidence to one piece per indicator when previously it was two or three pieces per indicator; and THE needing to expand its panel of reviewers and assessment processes given the increased participation of institutions. The global appetite for participation in this ranking remains unabated. This year, 2,318 institutions across 130 countries have an overall rank, compared to 1,963 institutions in 2024 or 462 in 2019. Top performers Australian universities still perform remarkably well and dominate at the top. Among the world’s top 50, 10 are from Australia, followed by Canada (7), the United Kingdom (6) and South Korea (5). Western Sydney University ranks first globally for a fourth consecutive year. This is an impressive achievement considering this ranking continues to evolve and is resource-intensive to undertake. The UK’s University of Manchester remains second and is followed by Kyungpook National University in South Korea, Griffith University in Australia, the University of Tasmania, Arizona State University (Tempe) in the US, Queen’s University in Canada, the University of Alberta in Canada, Aalborg University in Denmark and Universitas Airlangga in Indonesia. This makes up the top 10 for 2025. Other standout Australian institutions among the world’s top 50 are Flinders, a new entrant and ranked equal 21st with Japan’s Yonsei University; Central Queensland University, the University of Wollongong and University of Technology Sydney, the University of Newcastle and Macquarie University, all of which rank in the 25 to 50 range. Other institutions which have made solid gains include Pusan National University in South Korea, National Taiwan University, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals in Saudi Arabia, the University of Malaya, King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in India. Over the past seven years, the University of Manchester has been the only institution that has ranked every year in the world’s top 10. Western Sydney University in Australia also stands out, as it has ranked every year in the top 20; but most importantly, as indicated, it has been number one for the past four years. The University of Auckland in New Zealand also stands out, as it has ranked four times in the top 10 and twice in the top 20, now standing at 28th globally. Bologna University in Italy, British Columbia and McMaster in Canada, RMIT in Australia, Queen’s and Alberta in Canada, and Arizona State in the US are also universities that have done very well over the years. All these universities have been committed to environmental sustainability and progressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals for several years. Listings and preferred SDGs As we have seen, the 17 SDGs are not all viewed equally across countries and world regions. Universities prefer some SDGs over others due to differences in institutional missions, priorities or hierarchical needs. They are also driven by the likelihood of ranking higher in the rankings. Aside from the compulsory SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals), the top four most reported SDGs globally, in descending order, are SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG 5 (Quality Education) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), while the least reported SDGs globally are, in ascending order, SDG 14 (Life below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Let me reiterate two observations I made in 2022. Firstly, participation in THE IR is not for the faint-hearted. We have seen how some institutions have done very well in some years and have then dropped. And we have observed that institutions that have long-term strategic objectives reap the rewards years down the line. Dissecting the results and comparing performance against best practice provide a solid basis to develop a plan for improvement. Secondly, attention to detail matters when preparing a submission for THE ; in 2024 alone, THE says it received more than 270,000 evidence-based documents from participating institutions across the globe. We have also seen that weak or poorly presented evidence is costly. AI assessing the evidence The sheer volume of information submitted by institutions has meant THE has had to employ more staff to assess all evidence provided by institutions. THE has said that about 50% of the evidence submitted in 2024 by institutions was found to be not relevant, highlighting a real struggle among universities to identify and submit appropriate supporting materials. THE has also said that using traditional human validation methods alone is unsustainable given the volume of evidence submitted if consistency and accuracy are to be ensured. As a result, THE is increasingly adopting AI practices as one step in the evaluation process. Large language models are being considered to support the evidence validation process. This step is welcome and a game changer, but it will also bring a degree of variability and a need for ongoing adjustment. The use of AI also has the potential to further entrench institutional inequalities. Resource-rich institutions and those that have developed AI frameworks and models are likely to benefit the most. Showcasing societal contributions Across the globe, many research-intensive and resource-rich institutions do not opt to participate in THE IR (or any other of the existing sustainability assessments) because they fear reputational damage if they fail to perform well. However, these assessments equip academics and university leadership with invaluable information to drive improvement and evidence-based pathways for impact to government, civil society and the market. Furthermore, participation in THE IR among universities ranked in the top 100 for THE World University Rankings (THE WUR) is limited. On average, 20 universities participate year on year, but as a proportion of all universities, the proportion has decreased from 4.1% in 2019 to 1.0% in 2024. Over the years, we have seen increased participation in THE IR from universities which are either ranked outside the top 500 or not ranked in THE WUR. It should be part of a university’s social contract to showcase how they are working towards addressing the environmental, social and economic challenges that we face. This is one of the benefits of participating in these external assessments. Mitigating volatility At the same time, THE should strive towards mitigating the excessive volatility we see year on year. As I have argued in the past, there is not much that changes in institutional practice year on year to warrant the institutional ups and downs observed in SDG 17 and thus in the overall score. The variability we see often comes from THE ’s methodological changes rather than the institutions themselves. Improved stability in results may cause more universities ranking in the top 100 in THE WUR to participate. In fact, elite and research-intensive universities are likely to do well since research metrics account for 27% of the score for each SDG. There is also considerable variability in the accuracy of the data provided by institutions. This is unsurprising given the patchy practices of data capture and data use among decision-makers, along with the variability of both data governance and data infrastructure across the globe. THE may also consider having a global panel of educational planning experts across world regions to guide their assessment practices, including dealing with data quality issues. The review panel can play a vital role in maintaining the integrity and quality of the evidence submitted by institutions. Rather than generating an overall score every year, it may need to be produced every two years, allowing institutions to submit data and evidence on selected SDGs in between years. For years I have advocated that a ranking of universities based on the SDGs is best served if it is contextualised on a regional basis or national standing on a like-to-like basis. This means turning away from the strong emphasis on global rankings and instead bolstering a focus on regions. This is a key opportunity for THE to make a difference in higher education across the regions. Discontinuation of niche rankings Critics of global rankings who argue that global university rankings have too much influence over universities will be pleased with THE ’s recent announcement that it will cease to produce the niche Young University Rankings, World Reputation Rankings, and Online Learning Rankings. These changes provide THE with the opportunity to focus on the WUR, which is intended to be for universities that are global-facing and research-intensive. Further, the Interdisciplinary Science Rankings will continue to be a good product under the global rankings of research-intensive universities. Lastly, THE will discontinue the Sub-Saharan Africa University Rankings. The 2024 ranking included 129 universities from 22 countries. The ranking included 20 metrics across five pillars designed to be relevant to the region. This ranking was controversial, as some participating universities questioned its value. However, the ranking has highlighted not only the importance of having timely data but also the imperative for universities to be better resourced for teaching, research endeavours and institutional management. THE will continue with the regional rankings focused on Asia, Arab countries and Latin America; however, these will be linked to the WUR. It’s worth also recalling that QS discontinued its ranking of top universities under 50 and best universities for employability some years ago. QS continues to produce four regional rankings. It makes sense for QS and THE to simplify and redefine regional rankings from the same set of indicators used to rank universities for the WUR. At the end of the day, they are both private companies. However, these changes will further increase the homogenisation of higher education across the world, diluting the universities’ ability to be differentiated within countries and across regions. Although all universities are interconnected and influenced by global developments, not every university is globally focused or aspiring to be globally recognised. Increasingly, regionalism and strategic alliances will have greater consequences for universities, and we must focus on strengthening these relationships. In the coming days, THE will be announcing changes to the impact rankings. In a subsequent commentary, I will discuss the implications of these changes. However, I would suggest that stability in results and the increased participation of research-intensive, historical and resource-rich institutions is by no means a fait accompli .

University World News,Calls for specialist doctor training to stay in universities,27 May 2025,"INDONESIA Calls for specialist doctor training to stay in universities Kafil Yamin 27 May 2025 Tweet A plan to reform education for specialist doctors, which threatens to shake up university medical faculties, has sparked strong resistance from senior doctors, academics and politicians who have called on President Prabowo Subianto to remove the minister behind the reforms from his cabinet. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin’s plan is to remove the training of specialist doctors from top universities and locate it in hospitals because, as Sadikin put it, the system is currently “too exclusive, too expensive, yet inefficient”. Sadikin recently disclosed that around 3,000 specialist doctors are produced annually, meeting only 10% of the demand for specialist doctors – estimated at around 30,000. “It means it will take more than 10 years to meet the demand,” he said. “Indonesia is short of specialist doctors because its education is still limited to top universities. They are only able to produce a relatively constant number of graduates while demand for specialist doctors gets higher and higher throughout the country. “The solution is for this centralised education system to be decentralised and distributed to hospitals,” Sadikin said during a House of Representatives hearing on 26 May. Last week, senior professors in medicine from three of Indonesia’s top universities – the University of Indonesia (UI), Padjadjaran University and Airlangga University – in a joint statement called on Subianto to review Sadikin’s policies, which he has already begun to implement, and replace the health minister. “Education of doctors should remain in universities with standardised academic quality,” the professors said in a joint statement on 16 May. “We are concerned about the doctor shortage, and we have been working to deal with the issue without sacrificing the quality of doctor education,” said Professor Ari Fahrial Syam, dean of the medicine faculty at UI, at a press conference in Jakarta. Reading from the joint statement, Siti Setiati, internal medicine specialist and UI senior lecturer, said: “Medical and specialist doctor education cannot be simplified as being just technical training. Doctors’ education is lengthy, competitive and a gradual academic process. The best doctor education takes place in medical faculties that are of global standard. “Good health services can only be provided by medical professionals who are educated to a high standard. If the standard is brought down, then the quality of medical services will also go down.” The Association of the Universitas Indonesia Graduate Association also called for Sadikin’s removal. “We demand [that] President Prabowo change the health minister,” Wawan Mulyawan, a neurosurgeon and association chairman, was quoted by Tempo magazine as saying on 21 May. Uneven distribution of specialists Indonesia has seen an uneven distribution of specialist doctors over the last few decades, according to the health minister. He said the government should immediately address this through hospital-based specialist training as one of the solutions. The first phase of the new system, launched officially on 6 May, has been rolled out in six main teaching hospitals that manage specialist medical education programmes. The new system will operate in parallel with the existing system to narrow the shortage of specialist doctors. Under the new system, doctors wanting to specialise will not pay tuition fees and will keep their jobs while studying. So, they will continue to work and receive salaries, he said. Currently, doctors stop working and pay high fees to study for a specialism and apply for new jobs after graduating. “This model exists only in Indonesia,” according to the minister. Ministry data reveals that 24 university faculties around the country provide specialist doctors’ education. Under the new policy, 420 hospitals throughout the country will also provide such education and training. The minister also wants to expand government health services to the community by transferring doctors and specialist doctors from major hospitals to local hospitals and by allowing non-specialist doctors to perform caesareans, considered high-risk surgery. Ari said that transferring doctors to other places was an unwise decision because almost all transferred doctors are also lecturers. “When they are suddenly transferred, it is at the expense of their students,” he noted. Ari said that at UI the number of medical students, including those studying for specialisms, had expanded. “During the last five years, we increased the seat allocation for new undergraduate students by 20% to 30%, for specialist doctors by 30% and for sub-specialist doctors by 40% to 50%.” UI also built medical faculties in Bengkulu, Palangkaraya, and West Papua, in Banten, through cooperation with local universities, Ari said. Support from regional and junior doctors Despite resistance from academics and senior doctors, the minister’s reforms have received wide support from regional and junior doctors. “I am a general doctor who serves in Papua. I failed the specialist doctor education entry test several times, and was left out [of the system] by those who paid,” said one comment on Metro TV’s YouTube channel. Others said the cost of specialist medical education was “remarkably high”. Reform would help medical workers and enable the health system to change for the better, they said. Professors who object to the changes have called for an end to the “negative framing” of medical services in Indonesia, such as descriptions of specialist doctor education as expensive and unaffordable for medical students on moderate incomes. The minister has acknowledged the changes could shake up “certain interests” but underlined that the policies were designed to benefit the wider community.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20250527153629226
University World News,Western Sydney University tops THE Impact Rankings again,14 June 2024,"GLOBAL Western Sydney University tops THE Impact Rankings again Brendan O’Malley 14 June 2024 Tweet Western Sydney University, Australia, has topped the overall Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings for the third year in a row. Australia dominates the top of the overall rankings with four institutions in the top 10 and five in the top 20: Western Sydney University (1st), University of Tasmania (=2nd), RMIT University (5th), UNSW Sydney (7th) and University of Technology, Sydney (=13th). In the overall ranking Canada and the United Kingdom both had two in the top 10 and both had three in the top 20. India has the most universities in the ranking – 105. But the UK had the most in the top 100 with 25. The THE Impact Rankings, released on 13 June, is now in its sixth year and has quadrupled in scale since it was launched in 2019 with 1,963 institutions ranked, up from 462 institutions in the first year. It ranks universities’ contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) – by comparing data on each institution’s performance in SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals and a minimum of three of the remaining 16 SDGs, which cover a broad range of global challenges, from poverty and health, to climate action, employment and innovation, reducing inequality and life on land and in water. There is also a ranking table for each of the 17 SDGs. A record 2,152 universities from 125 countries/regions were assessed, which is a significant increase on last year where 1,705 universities were ranked, representing a 26% increase. There are 595 newly ranked universities and universities from 14 countries have participated in the ranking for the first time this year, which are: Albania, Angola, Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Libya, Malawi, North Macedonia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Yemen. According to THE, the methodology for the 2024 ranking involves collecting data on indicators “to provide comprehensive and balanced comparisons across four broad areas: research, stewardship, outreach and teaching”. The data used refer to the closest academic year to January to December 2022. A university’s total score in a given year is calculated by combining its score in SDG 17 with its best three results on the remaining 16 SDGs. SDG 17 accounts for 22 per cent of the total score, while the other SDGs each carry a weighting of 26 per cent. This means that different universities are scored based on a different set of SDGs, depending on their focus. The score for the overall ranking is an average of the last two years’ total scores. Phil Baty, Times Higher Education’s chief global affairs officer, described the THE Impact Ranking as “an extremely valuable tool for universities, governments, funders, policymakers and prospective students to see how universities are demonstrating to all they serve how they’re delivering social and economic impact on the world stage”. The highest ranked higher education institution, in the overall category, in each region is: • Africa: University of Johannesburg, South Africa – joint 36th. • Arab region: King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Saudi Arabia – joint 81st. • Asia: Yonsei University (Seoul campus), South Korea – 11th. • Australasia: Western Sydney University, Australia – 1st. • Europe: University of Manchester, UK – joint 2nd. • North America: University of Alberta, Canada – 6th. • Latin America: National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico – 64th. Western University, in addition to coming top overall, also came first in the world for SDG 5, Gender Equality; 3rd for SDG 15 Life on Land; and fourth in three goals, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, and SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals. In addition it was eighth in the world for SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities and ninth for SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Interim Vice-Chancellor and President of Western Sydney University, Professor Clare Pollock, said : “Delivering positive and meaningful community impact sits at the heart of everything we do at Western Sydney University. For 35 years it has been core to our mission, inspiring and motivating us to improve people’s lives and to be a force for change. “It is a remarkable and defining moment for an Australian university to be recognised as number one in the world in such a highly competitive global rankings system for three years in a row.” Pollock said the University’s teaching, research and international partnerships are fully aligned to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDGs), which are embedded across all the University’s operations. “For Western Sydney University, the Sustainable Development Goals are more than aspirational – they underpin our strategic direction, institutional values and organisational culture,” said Professor Pollock. “The SDGs are the driving force behind our action plans and can be seen right across our teaching, research, campus operations and engagement, inspiring collaborations between students, staff and our community partners to tackle complex challenges such as climate transitions and social justice. The University of Manchester, as well as coming second overall, came top in two individual SDGs, SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and SDG15 – Life on Land. Professor Nalin Thakkar, Vice-President for Social Responsibility at The University of Manchester, said: “Social responsibility is, of course, a core goal for us so we’re delighted to be ranked top in the UK, top in Europe and second in the world. “These rankings cover our full range of functions – across research, students, public engagement and university operations – and we’re proud to be part of this growing community of universities who want to improve our society, economy and environment in all that we do.” Highest placed institutions in all 17 SDGs Globally UK universities topped the most rankings for individual SDGs with five compared with Australia (four), South Korea (two), and a geographically diverse selection of countries with one each: Indonesia, Canada, India, Denmark, Nigeria, Germany, Netherlands, United States and Malaysia (some of these were joint winners of SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). The highest placed higher education institutions for each SDG were: • SDG 1 No poverty: Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR) (Indonesia) – Research on poverty and support for students from poor families. • SDG 2 Zero hunger: Queen’s University (Canada)– Research on hunger, teaching on food sustainability and commitment to tackling food waste and hunger on campus and locally. • SDG 3 Good health and well-being: JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research (India) – Research on key diseases and conditions, support for healthcare professions, and health of students and staff. • SDG 4 Quality education: Aalborg University (Denmark) – Contributions to early years and lifelong learning and commitment to inclusive education. • SDG 5 Gender equality: Western Sydney University (Australia) – Research and policies on gender equality and commitment to recruiting and promoting women. • SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation: University of Exeter (UK)Research related to water, water usage and commitment to ensuring good water management in wider community. • SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy: Afe Babalola University (Nigeria) – Energy research, energy use and policies, and commitment to promoting energy efficiency. • SDG 8 Decent work and economic growth: Kyungpook National University (South Korea)– Economics research, employment practices and share of studentstaking work placements. • SDG 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure: Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), RWTH Aachen University (Germany), Technical University of Munich (Germany), TU Dresden (Germany), University of Edinburgh (UK), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Germany), University of Stuttgat (Germany) and Yonsei University (Seoul campus) (South Korea) – Research on industry and innovation, number of patents and spin-off companies and research income from industry. • SDG 10 Reduced inequalities: RMIT University (Australia) – Research on social inequalities, policies on discrimination and commitment to recruiting staff and students from under-represented groups. • SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities: University of Manchester (UK) – Research on sustainability, role as custodians of arts and heritage and internal approaches to sustainability. • SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production: Bournemouth University (UK) and King’s College London (UK) – Research on responsible consumption and approach to the sustainable use of resources. • SDG 13 Climate action: University of Tasmania (Australia) – Research on climate change, use of energy and preparations for dealing with consequences of climate change. • SDG 14 Life below water: Arizona State University (Tempe) (United States) – Research on life below water and education on and support for aquatic ecosystems. • SDG 15 Life on land: University of Manchester (UK) – Research on life on land and education on and support for land ecosystems. • SDG 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions: Universiti Sains Malaysia (Malaysia)– Research on peace and justice, participation as advisers for government and policies on academic freedom. • SDG 17 Partnerships for the goals: University of Technology Sydney (Australia) – The broader ways in which universities support the SDGs throughcollaboration with other countries, promotion of best practices and publication of data. Bayu Arie Fianto PhD, Head of the SDGs Centre at, Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR) which achieved the top global position for SDG 1: No Poverty – as well as fourth globally on SDG 5: Gender Equality – said that UNAIR has long been implementing poverty eradication programmes, including waiving or reducing tuition fees and engaging in community entrepreneurship development programmes. “The goal is for society to be prosperous and empowered,” he said in a statement on the university’s website. UNAIR’s entrepreneurship development program manifests as community service. Participants receive training on startups, networking skills, and financial support. Additionally, research and publication play a crucial role in achieving the No Poverty goal. UNAIR also collaborates with various partners to address poverty. “We collaborate with many villages, business communities, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We also collaborate with various units and directorates within UNAIR and with Islamic social institutions that partner with UNAIR to help the community,” Fianto said. The two most popular SDGs (excluding SDG 17) are SDG 4 – quality education – with 1,681 universities, followed by SDG 3 – good health and well-being with 1,498 and SDG 5 – gender equality and 1,361 universities.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20240614135715476
University World News,Universities support Palestinian students with scholarships,23 November 2023,"INDONESIA Universities support Palestinian students with scholarships Kafil Yamin 23 November 2023 Tweet Amid mass rallies against Israel’s ongoing bombing of Palestine, Indonesia’s Syiah Kuala University in Aceh province is taking a further step by providing scholarships for 50 Palestinian students, after an agreement was signed on 16 November by the Palestinian Ambassador for Indonesia Zuhair Al-Shun and the university’s Rector Marwan. An IDR110 million (US$7,070) donation by the university for the Palestinians was also announced. “This is a humanitarian call for Palestinians who are suffering from the Israeli invasion,” said Marwan, also urging more donations from people in Aceh. Head of International Relations at Syiah Kuala University, Muzailin Affan, said the institution’s commitment to Palestine would not stop with these scholarships and donations: “We are seeking broader cooperation with Palestinian universities. Later we will have student exchanges and joint research.” Scholarships for Palestinian students are also being provided by Indonesia’s Defense Ministry. On 8 November, Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto welcomed around 22 Palestinian students. During a reception for Palestinian students at the Ministry of Defense office in Jakarta, he told the Palestinian ambassador the students would undertake undergraduate studies at the Defense University for five years. Lieutenant General Jonni Mahroza, rector of the Defense University – which is also known as Unhan (Universitas Pertahanan) – told the university’s staff to act as substitutes for Palestinian students’ parents. “They are far from their families, who are in a very difficult situation,” he said. The 22 students, who are from the West Bank, will study medicine, pharmacy, electrical engineering or information engineering after a one-year preliminary programme studying Bahasa Indonesia at the Unhan Language Training Centre. Close ties with Palestine Indonesia has close ties with Palestine, including funding the 140-bed Indonesian hospital that opened in 2016 in the north of Gaza City, staffed by Palestinians. For more than a week this month, the Indonesian hospital was the only clinic in northern Gaza still treating patients, until it was targeted by Israeli forces on 20 November. Indonesian President Joko Widodo strongly condemned the Israeli bombing of the much larger Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on 17 October, where wounded Palestinians and residents were seeking shelter. (Israel and Western countries blamed the bombing on a failed rocket launch from within Gaza by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.) Widodo denounced the attack as violating international humanitarian law. A series of anti-Israel rallies has been taking place since earlier this month in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. One of the biggest of around two million people was held at National Monument Square, just next to the United States embassy. Some demonstrators marched to the US embassy as Indonesia does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel, and there is no Israeli embassy in the country. The scholarship programme is part of the Indonesia-Palestine cooperation in education, signed by Subianto, the Indonesian defence minister, and Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Ibrahim Shayyeh in Jakarta in October last year. “In future, we are ready to receive more students with this scholarship. This is one of the government’s commitments supporting the independence of the people of Palestine,” Subianto remarked. Airlangga University in East Java has granted scholarships to five Palestinian students. Rector Professor Mohammad Nasih officially awarded the scholarships during the university’s 69th anniversary on 15 November in Surabaya. Nasih said the university was very concerned about Palestinian students who are still unable to get in touch with their families in Gaza, a situation which could affect their education. “We are morally called on to give a hand,” he said in his anniversary address. Support from Muhammadiyah Indonesia’s second largest Muslim non-governmental organisation, Muhammadiyah, has long supported Palestine with education, health and humanitarian assistance. It has also built schools for Palestinian children in Beirut, Lebanon, which have been in operation for about three years. “There are many Palestinian students studying in universities under Muhammadiyah administration in Indonesia – all with scholarships,” Professor Abdul Mu’ti, secretary general of Muhammadiyah, told University World News . “We also provide short course fellowships for Palestinians who are interested in studying Islam and Muslims in Indonesia,” he said, adding that this is a long-term programme that has not been disrupted by the ongoing war. Muhammadiyah is known as a modern and reformist Muslim organisation, whose core business is education and health. It has thousands of schools, universities and hospitals throughout Indonesia. Muhammadiyah is also recognised as the richest Muslim group in Indonesia and is well ahead of the government in providing educational assistance and donations for Palestine.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20231123150609232
University World News,First students to sit ‘free learning’ university entry exam,8 February 2023,"INDONESIA First students to sit ‘free learning’ university entry exam Kafil Yamin 08 February 2023 Tweet This month, Indonesia’s state universities open for the registration of new students, the first cohort to take the new, revamped national university admission test called SNBT, the Indonesian acronym for ‘test-based national selection’, which is intended to move away from rote learning and improve university access for less-advantaged pupils. Anindito Aditomo, head of Indonesia’s Agency for Standardisation, Curriculum and Assessment in Education under the Ministry of Education and Culture, said the new admission test, which will be held for the first time in May, is part of the “free learning” principle of the current curriculum. Students are free to learn what they want without being confined by their previous education. “The new selection test measures not what test-takers have learned and memorised; instead it mainly assesses their understanding of what they have learned and memorised,” Aditomo said on 10 January in Jakarta, marking the opening of the national university registration. The SNBT replaces the previous National Admission Selection for State Universities (SNMPTN) which focused on academic or subject knowledge. The new exam does away with subject exams and focuses instead on reasoning, mathematics and literacy in the national language of Bahasa Indonesia and in English. Apart from the new SNBT, which will be the basis of entry for around 30% of total seats in state universities, students still have two other ways to access state universities. Another 20% can enter via the SNBP, or Achievement-Based National Selection, based on their school performance and scores. Around 50% enter universities via the Jalur Mandiri , which literally means ‘autonomous channel’, conducted by individual state universities with their own test standards. Reasoning and critical thinking The Education and Culture Ministry announced the new admission test on its Instagram account on 14 October 2022. “In order to improve reasoning capability and critical thinking among students, from 2023 the national selection of state university students will no longer be [via] the academic test [but] instead via a cognitive potential test, mathematical logic and literacy in Bahasa Indonesia and English,” it stated. Asriyanti (one name), head of the ministry’s Center for Educational Assessment, said the four skills – reasoning, mathematics, literacy and foreign language – were the foundation for acquiring scientific knowledge in any field. “A student can become an expert in technology only if he or she is good in mathematics and communication,” she told local media. “Now students are not only required to read a lot. [But] they should read critically,” she added. The ministry has said the exam is intended to encourage students to learn more widely and comprehensively. It measures the individual’s cognitive and reasoning potential and capacity to learn new things, then to go deeper into selected subjects at the university stage. The Director-General of Higher Education Nizam Nizam said on the ministry’s ( Dikbudristek ) web page that the new test aims “to connect the dynamic transformation that has already taken place at lower education levels with higher education”. “This is a development of the free learning principle,” he asserted, adding that the new test encourages prospective university students to hone problem-solving abilities, rather than memorise theories, data and information. More inclusive Notably, the new admission test gives test-takers an equal opportunity to enter universities and is not dependent on their previous educational background and basic knowledge, particularly those who might be hindered by less knowledge in particular subjects. Subject-based tests are known to hinder disadvantaged pupils from less developed areas with poor educational facilities. Similar to Scholastic Aptitude Tests or SATs, the new admissions exam is a standardised test which measures basic critical thinking, reading, mathematics and writing skills. Most Indonesian colleges and universities already request SAT score results from applicants. But not everyone welcomed the move away from subject-specific testing. Sukardiman (one name), director of education at the Surabaya-based Airlangga University, said the new test ignores the social science-natural science division that enables students to choose study fields that suit them. “In higher education, specialisation is important. The SNBT makes the specialism insignificant,” Sukardiman told University World News . A wider range of students Dr Ramdany (one name), a senior lecturer at the Jakarta-based Muhammadiyah Economic High School, sees it differently, saying the new test provides more opportunity to widen the range of higher education aspirants. “Specialisation is important, but ‘free’ education is more [important],” he told University World News . “Those who enrol in a highly competitive programme will face tough tests in line with their study field. I think if they fail after two semesters they have to leave. This is a sort of natural selection,” Ramdany said. “But if they succeed, then they can be assured that they have the ability to pursue what they are trying to achieve in their study,” he added. Nowadays it is not enough to be smart, he added. “Education is about reasoning, a good mentality, integrity and commitment to one’s own values. We will be left behind if we adopt education that only deals with intelligence. Technology has now been able to transfer human intelligence to robots and computers,” Ramdany said. But “personality, integrity and character cannot be transferred to machines and computers,” he added.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20230208072028234
University World News,Strong focus on SDGs intensifies university collaborations,1 October 2022,"INDONESIA Strong focus on SDGs intensifies university collaborations Kafil Yamin 01 October 2022 Tweet The strong performance of Indonesian universities in the Times Higher Education ( THE ) Impact Rankings shows that universities in developing countries can compete well with their counterparts in developed countries. Inclusion in the Impact Ranking, which assesses universities’ work in addressing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also “encourages so-called research for impact, which results in innovations that directly benefit society”, says Arif Satria, rector of IPB University. The standout performance by an Indonesian institution in this year’s rankings, released in April, was the University of Indonesia (UI), ranking in the world’s top 10, at ninth, for research and action to eradicate poverty. SDG 1 (No poverty) aims to eradicate every form of extreme poverty, currently measured as people living on less than $US1.25 a day, by 2030. It includes ensuring that the poor and the vulnerable have equal rights to economic resources, access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, as well as appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance. Other SDGs address ending hunger, ensuring healthy lives, ending inequality, reducing inequality, providing good quality education, encouraging employability, taking action on climate change and threats to biodiversity, and promoting peaceful, inclusive societies. Universities are called to work together to find solutions for these world problems. UI is followed by a strong performance by other Indonesian universities on the ‘Zero hunger’ SDG – IPB University (Bogor Agricultural University), Gadjah Mada University (UGM), Padjadjaran University and Brawijaya University respectively in 11th, 16th, 32nd and 34th position for the ‘Zero hunger’ SDG in the Impact Rankings. ‘Zero hunger’ includes action on food security, improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. For example, on 25 August, the UI planted a thousand trees on campus, part of a pilot project for SDG 15 (Life on land). Jatna Supriatna, senior lecturer at UI, attributed the success of Indonesian universities in the Impact Rankings to the intensification of their research on global challenges. “What elevates them to such a significant rise is research,” he told University World News . “UI, for example, has increased its research publications by 20% this year alone. It means UI spent more funds on research.” Only 25% of the university’s funding is from the government. Three quarters is from UI’s own revenue sources, including its endowment fund . More international research collaboration The focus on SDGs led to Indonesian universities participating in further international collaborations. Jatna, who has represented Indonesia in various UN meetings on sustainable development, said “if the objectives of research are big issues or global problems, an individual university would not be able to do it alone. It needs partners.” “The University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and IPB are now in joint research and innovation partnerships with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in various fields, stemming from energy, sustainable transport and nanotechnology, food safety, environmental sensing to climate change,” said Jatna, who is also chairman of the UI Research Center for Climate Change . “Under the UN-sanctioned SDGs, universities are called to incorporate all aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals in their curricula, which enables students to gain knowledge and skill necessary to address the challenges of SDGs,” he added. The university launched its SDGs hub in April 2019 to bring together the university’s activities and to strengthen partnerships globally. UI Rector Ari Kuncoro said in a statement on 20 September that since 2021 his university has collaborated with 383 universities and institutions from 49 countries. “Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, our research, innovation and social work was increasing. Our lecturers, researchers and students are more active,” Kuncoro said in a press statement. ‘Developing countries can also perform well’ There are other universities in Indonesia that have performed well in Impact Rankings. In THE ’s national-level ranking for Indonesia, IPB University ranked first on SDG 4 (Quality education), second on SDG 14 (Life below water), and third on SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG 13 (Life on land). In the international Impact Ranking IPB University ranked 51st on ‘No poverty’, 45th on ‘Zero hunger’, 46th in ‘Life below water’ and 73rd in ‘Life on land’. IPB’s rector Arif Satria, said the Impact Rankings “helped universities sharpen their strategies in research and innovation.” IPB has developed genetically modified ‘super seeds’ for rice and papaya, called IPS3S for rice and IPB9 for Papaya Calina. The IPB3 paddy seed is more resistant to disease and produces 11 tonnes of rice per hectare, almost double the yield of regular seed, which produces around six tonnes per hectare on average. The new seeds are now available at agribusiness outlets in major cities in Indonesia. The IPB9, meanwhile, produces papaya fruit with thicker, sweeter flesh, that does not easily rot, and is of a more handy size than the normal large and heavy fruit. While engaged in global research cooperation on tropical biodiversity, the university also has a forest area for educational purposes, named Gunung Walat , in Sukabumi, West Java, which has become a model for small-scale sustainable forestry. Floating hospitals Muhammad Miftahussurur, vice rector of Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java, said his university had done well, particularly on the SDGs relating to no poverty, good health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and partnership. Airlangga University, which says it is the country’s second biggest producer of health-related research, built the Ksatria Airlangga floating hospitals to provide healthcare services to thousands of people on over 60 remote islands, including specialist surgeries and eye surgery that would normally be out of reach on the islands. The project also conducts research on the islands during the visits to gather data that can be useful for other clinicians and researchers, and holds webinars aimed at doctors, nurses and other health workers. Airlangga University has also set up an SDGs Centre to support the university’s work on SDGs. International collaboration Dr Eugene Sebastian executive director of the Australia-Indonesia Centre , a research consortium of 11 universities – seven from Indonesia and four from Australia – says he is not surprised Indonesian universities are doing well in the Impact Rankings. “I see them being highly competitive in areas aligned with the SDGs, especially in areas such as poverty and water,” he explained. “It is a significant part of their work and supported by national and multilateral funding.” Sebastian says such topics are central to a growing number of Indonesian universities’ international partnerships, with the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada and IPB particularly “active” in this regard. The “best Indonesian universities are partnering with the best universities abroad to research and publish in this area”, he said. “They see the importance of international networks to help tackle SDGs, which also invariably contributes to rankings and reputational lift.” The Australia-Indonesia Centre consortium brings together UI, UGM, IPB, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Hasanuddin University, and Airlangga University with Australia’s Melbourne University, Monash University, Queensland University and Western Australia University to tackle community issues such as water, energy, food and health.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20220930114603875
University World News,Row over honorary doctorates awarded to politicians,1 February 2022,"INDONESIA Row over honorary doctorates awarded to politicians Kafil Yamin 01 February 2022 Tweet Indonesian Vice President Ma’ruf Amin and Minister for State-owned Enterprises Erick Thohir were scheduled to be granted honorary doctorate degrees by the State University of Jakarta (UNJ) for ‘extraordinary achievement’ in their respective work last October, but the award ceremony has not yet taken place. It is not immediately clear whether the granting of the titles has been abrogated or merely postponed, but the plan has faced strong opposition from the UNJ Lecturers Alliance and Student Organisation who say the transactional approach to honorary degrees undermines the university’s autonomy and reputation. Ma’ruf Amin was to be awarded an honorary doctorate for nation building and Erick Thohir for merit in sports, UNJ Rector Komarudin announced on 1 September last year for award in October. “Giving honorary academic titles to Ma’ruf Amin and Erick Thohir is obviously inappropriate. It’s a kind of joke. Ma’ruf Amin and Erick Thohir have no academic achievements whatsoever to deserve the titles,” according to UNJ Lecturers Alliance spokesperson Ubedillah Badrun, adding that “Erick Thohir is a businessman. He has no record in sports. Yet he will be granted doctorate degree in sports. This is totally ridiculous.” UNJ internal regulations do not allow honorary academic titles to be granted to politicians and officials during their term of office. “This regulation is intended to maintain the autonomy and reputation of UNJ,” said Badrun. The regulations also stipulate that honorary awards should be from ‘A’ category certified programmes at the university – the top category awarded by the national university accreditation body known by its Indonesian acronym BAN-PT ( Badan Akreditasi Nasional Perguruan Tinggi ). However, UNJ does not have an ‘A’ category social and political studies programme for the award to Amin. The honorary degree for Thohir is even more problematic. “For one, he is the minister. For another, he is a businessman. So what qualifies him for an honorary doctorate in sports?” Badrun said. UNJ provides its own reasons for granting the honorary titles. “Ma’ruf Amin’s thoughts and ideas on religions and nationhood are a great contribution to this diverse nation. He shows common ground for all elements of the nation to live in harmony, especially in relation with Islam and the state,” UNJ Rector Komarudin told University World News . “UNJ is an actor in nation building. So Mr Ma’ruf Amin is actually making a contribution to the academic world. He has everything it takes to get an honorary doctorate title.” “The same reason applies to Erick Thohir, who dedicates much of his time, energy [and] wealth to building sports,” Komarudin added. Thohir, a member of the International Olympic Committee, owns Indonesia’s Satria Muda basketball club, which is always on top of Indonesia’s basketball league, and he served as an honorary board member of the Indonesian Basketball Association in 2015-19. He has also been the president of the Southeast Asian Basketball Association since 2006. Thohir built the BritAma Arena, an indoor sports arena hosting basketball games in Kelapa Gading, Jakarta, and he also jointly owned top European football club Inter Milan in 2013. Other politicians awarded honorary degrees UNJ is not the only Indonesian university to grant officials, politicians and other influential figures honorary doctor titles. In February 2021, the State University of Semarang (UNNES) drew strong criticism for granting an honorary doctorate to the former chief of the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI), Nurdin Halid, a controversial figure as he was involved in corruption cases running to billions of rupiah and in 2007 was sentenced to jail for two years. In 2018, the Institute of Public Administration (IPDN) granted Megawati Sukarnoputri, chairperson of the Indonesian Democracy Party of Struggle (PDI-P), an honorary doctorate in political science and administration. The following year, Diponegoro University bestowed an academic doctor title on her daughter, Puan Maharani, speaker of the lower house, the People’s Representative Council, and previously coordinating minister for human development and culture. There were many others in the years before. Susi Pudjiastuti, former maritime affairs and fisheries minister; Muhaimin Iskandar, chairman of Indonesia’s National Awakening Party (PKB); Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, former president of Indonesia; Airlangga Hartarto, minister for economic affairs; and Abdul Halim Iskandar, minister of villages, development of disadvantaged regions and transmigration, are among those granted honorary doctor titles in the past. “We won’t see this practice anymore I hope this year,” said Asep Saeful Muhtadi, senior lecturer at Bandung State Islamic University (UIN Bandung). Muhtadi, a member of the university council, was dismissed from the council in June 2014 for questioning the plan revealed that month to grant an honorary doctorate to the former governor of West Java, Ahmad Heryawan. “I was not against the title granting at all. I just asked what academic achievement the then governor had to deserve the honorary doctorate degree, which my fellow members of the university council could not answer,” Muhtadi told University World News , adding: “I was then excluded from the following deliberations although I was still a member of the university council.” In October 2020, “when Bandung State Islamic University (UIN Bandung) granted an honorary doctorate to H Syafruddin, a former Indonesian deputy police chief, I was not consulted or informed,” he added. Regulations on awarding honorary titles That the awards to Amin and Thohir have not yet taken place may not necessarily be due only to resistance from students and academics, but also for regulatory reasons. National regulations set a number of criteria for granting honorary academic titles. Honorary degrees can be given to Indonesian citizens or foreigners who have achieved extraordinary merit and dedication in science, technology, education and learning or in social, economic and cultural fields. Universities granting honorary degrees are required to have produced their own doctors and professors; to have a faculty or study programme corresponding to the fields of the honorary degree award; and to have at least three professors in those fields. But instead of complying with the national regulations, UNJ is even changing its own rules to grant the planned honorary doctorates, according to academics. “The UNJ university council will review the regulation and we hope we will come up with the new regulation soon,” UNJ spokesperson Syaifuddin told University World News . The university has said it merely wants to ‘harmonise’ its internal regulations to make them more consistent with national laws. “This harmonisation was not done to force the awarding of an honorary doctorate to someone,” a university statement in October said. Reni Suwarso, director of the Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies in Jakarta, deplored UNJ’s move to adjust its internal rules. Suwarso, who is also a lecturer of political science at the University of Indonesia, said this was because some “opportunists” within the university were seeking positions and projects from the government, “so they attempt to please those in power,” she told University World News . They are often well-connected to certain government officials who want academic titles to boost their public image and reputation. “Then they have mutual interests,” she added, noting that some of these academics were only concerned about their careers rather than the university itself. “Lecturers within universities want to become ministers or board directors in state corporations, while ministers and officials want to become doctors or professors to look decently educated and ‘intelligent’,” Suwarso said. UIN Bandung’s Muhtadi backed this view. “Usually, after the title-granting ceremony, funds or projects come in from the grantee’s office,” he said. “Certainly, this is a blessing for ‘opportunists’, but it should be stopped otherwise our universities will deteriorate from being centres of excellence to merely being instruments of power.” If the practice continues, it could diminish the value of the title for those who truly earned their doctorates, Muhtadi said. “It’s a long struggle and tiring endeavour. Then, all of a sudden, they see that some people can earn the academic title so easily and they begin to think there’s a shortcut to a doctorate.” “There’s nothing wrong with awarding honorary doctorate degrees, but it should be done on the basis of academic principles and values,” Muhtadi said. “The regulation [on honorary titles] exists, but it is ineffective,” he said, adding that it can only be effective if the education ministry shows concern.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20220201085420582

University World News,Job and pay fears add to COVID-19 concerns for students,23 October 2020,"INDONESIA Job and pay fears add to COVID-19 concerns for students Kafil Yamin 23 October 2020 Tweet Since Indonesia’s House of Representatives passed the so-called Omnibus bill into law this month, protests by workers and university students have spread around Indonesia, saying the law removes many benefits workers currently enjoy. Final-year university students, already struggling to make up for lost classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic downturn that has forced mass layoffs by businesses, now face a situation of little investment and rising unemployment as they attempt to enter the workforce. The 1,000-page Cipta Kerja bill, which means the jobs creation bill, amending almost 80 existing laws, passed on 5 October was seen as necessary by the government as the economy shrank by 5.32% in the second quarter this year. The government’s stated aim was to stimulate the economy and attract investment by relaxing business, labour and environmental laws and reducing and simplifying bureaucracy. It has been opposed by labour unions and student unions over its effects on workers, including a reduction in the minimum wage and severance pay and that it allows for longer working hours, saying they will continue to protest until the Omnibus law is abrogated. Poor outlook for new graduates The government has said the Omnibus law will provide jobs for the unemployed and young people. But the outlook is not good for graduating students, already hit by pandemic restrictions. Aina Hafidzah Salim (22), final-year student at the Indonesian Education University (UPI), said that, while throwing her support behind her fellow students demanding the abrogation of the new law, she is preparing for life after graduation. “First, I should be mentally strong. Second, I should have plans B and C. And, after all, I should leave [my] old mindset behind, that one’s job should correspond with one’s educational background. I should be willing and able to work in any field,” she said. Aina said she was considering starting her own fashion business. “This COVID stuff, social distancing, Omnibus law, has pushed me to become an independent woman.” Fathul Barri Adnan (23), a final-year student at Bandung Islamic University, started his own fish-breeding business, which, he said, is running well while he is busy with final assignments from his university. “I engage in various student discussions about what to do in this COVID pandemic and the Omnibus law. And we came to the common conclusion: try not to become job-seekers. Instead, be job creators,” Fathul said. “It is a big push for us to become a more independent generation.” Students’ participation in protests Earlier this month the ministry of education, culture and higher education issued a circular calling on students not to take part in the protests which turned violent in the past weeks. But students and workers protested this week in yellow, blue and green jackets to identify their universities. A yellow jacket signifies the University of Indonesia. A blue jacket represents the Diponegoro University (Undip), Airlangga University, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Bogor Agricultural University (IPB), and Padjadjaran University. A green jacket identifies students of the State Islamic University (UIN), Andalas University, the State University of Jakarta (UNJ) and Muhammadiyah University. Hundreds of students from Indonesia’s Association of University Student Executive Bodies (BEM SI), which groups some 26 universities, joined protests in Jakarta this week and last week despite the government’s warning. BEM SI coordinator for Greater Jakarta and Banten, Bagas Maroupindra, said students objected to the ministry’s circular on 9 October not to take part in the protests. “We see it as an attempt to silence the students’ movement,” he said. “The ministry’s call also ignores the people’s voice and aspiration, which should have been the foundation for decision-making,” he said, adding that the new law leads to “power centralisation which goes against the spirit of reformation”. The protests come a year after similar protests by students and others over attempts to introduce other laws , including the hollowing out of Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission – many of those laws were included in the Omnibus law. An earlier draft of the bill included provisions to allow profit-making providers into the education sector was withdrawn, as were draft provisions that foreign education institutions would be able to operate in Indonesia without cooperation with local entities. The laws on foreign branch campuses now remain unchanged. But the government has said the law would encourage more applied research, enabling the commercialisation of research through greater participation of state-owned enterprises and regional institutions. Final-year students struggle to complete the year The ministry has already announced a raft of emergency measures for universities to help alleviate the financial burden on students during the pandemic, and particularly to keep students from dropping out of university. These include more flexibility with tuition fee payments. As part of its efforts to help university students, the ministry has also called on university authorities not to give out ‘difficult assignments’. Final-year students have been given a one-semester extension by the ministry to give them more time to complete assignments. The government has yet to decide when normal classes will resume as COVID-19 cases have risen during a second wave from early September. Education and Culture Minister Nadiem Makarim has only said: “Soon”. But some face-to-face consultations are allowed, such as mentoring for theses and laboratory work. The social-distancing policy on campuses is limiting student students as they approach the end of the final semester, when students should have completed all their courses and required assignments. Final-year students say their research is restricted as they cannot go to book stores or libraries. Food stalls around campuses are closed or open only for a few hours. It takes more effort to find food to eat, students say. Many are unsure they will be able to graduate on schedule. Aina said she has set herself the target of graduating by the end of this year, but as she is able to have only online meetings with her supervisor, she is not sure it is possible. “I’m in consultation with my mentor for my thesis. And things were much easier with direct meetings,” she told University World News . “Now comes a new law that removes a number of workers’ rights, such as menstrual and maternity leave for female workers, permanent status of employees. It’s getting scary out there,” she said, adding: “I cannot lie to myself. I’m worried about my future. “With online consultation, I can’t respond or ask questions spontaneously. And I can’t understand fully what my mentor presents in such limited time. Repeated connection cuts really bother us,” she added. Yulia Sri Rezeki, a final-grade student of the Veteran National Development University (UPN Veteran), Jakarta, is struggling to obtain primary data for her undergraduate thesis, as she cannot go out into the field to collect data. “I am researching how aerobic dance positively affects diabetes in members of the dancing community. I am supposed to see them dancing and talk to them, but I can’t,” Yulia said. The diabetes aerobic dance used to be regularly held in two hospitals in East Jakarta. But, since the social distancing policy, the dance has been stopped. Via online interviews and questionnaires she found that many of the dance community members were too old to understand how the questionnaire forms should be filled in. “Video interviews are often interrupted by bad connections and questions have to be repeated again and again,” Yulia complained. As of 22 October, Indonesia has had 377,541 COVID-19 cases, killing 12,959 people.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20201023104618427
University World News,"Indonesia seeks own vaccine, rather than rely on Sinovac",19 September 2020,"INDONESIA Indonesia seeks own vaccine, rather than rely on Sinovac Kafil Yamin 19 September 2020 Tweet Clinching a deal last month with China’s biopharmaceutical giant Sinovac Biotech , Indonesia is set to produce anti-coronavirus vaccines locally under licence early next year after clinical trials conducted in Indonesia last month. At the same time the Indonesian government has decided to reduce reliance on imports by wholly researching, developing and producing its own COVID-19 vaccine, called Merah-Putih, by mid-2021. Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo has said the Sinovac vaccine will be in production by January next year but will not meet the country’s demand – Indonesia has a population of almost 270 million – so Indonesia must also produce its own. Merah-Putih, or red and white in English, is the name of Indonesia’s national flag, to symbolise that the vaccine is developed and produced by Indonesia, separate from China’s Sinovac vaccine known as CoronaVac that will use bulk vaccine antigen imported from China. CoronaVac has reached stage III human clinical trials involving 1,620 volunteers in Bandung, West Java, to determine efficacy and safety and has so far been showing signs of success. Human trials are also being conducted in Brazil. “Even if there are side effects but they correspond with our predictions, it will still be a successful trial,” Eddy Fadlyana, a member of the Sinovac vaccine testing team in Indonesia, told University World News , adding: “The predicted effects are a little pain on the injected part of the body, and minor fever.” So far there have been “no significant complaints”, according to the team, except that 21 volunteers out of 1,629 felt minor pain around the injection spot, which disappeared after a while, the team said. All the volunteers will be monitored by the clinical test team until the third week of December, with the results of the Sinovac clinical trials expected to be known between December 2020 and January 2021. However, in the case of unpredictable results, “we won’t take the further step into the production stage,” Eddy said. The World Health Organization has approved CoronaVac production at Bio Farma, which is Indonesia’s state-owned pharmaceutical company based in Bandung. It mainly exports generic drugs. Under its agreement with Sinovac for production for use in Indonesia, “production capacity is 100 million vaccine [doses], which can be increased to 250 million,” Eddy said, referring to a new production facility being built by Bio Farma. Country must produce its own vaccine On 16 September, Indonesia reported a total of 228,993 coronavirus cases, including 9,100 deaths. Addressing the nation on 24 August, President Joko Widodo said the pandemic has weakened Indonesia’s economy, society and education. “We hope once the Merah-Putih vaccine comes into play, the whole situation will soon be back to normal.” According to Amin Soebandrio, head of the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta, the Sinovac vaccine will only meet 20% of the country’s demand. “The remaining 80% will be met by our Merah-Putih vaccine,” he told University World News . “We have the capability and all the resources needed.” The Merah-Putih project involves Bio Farma, the Eijkman Institute, BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology), LIPI (Indonesian Institute of Sciences), BPOM (National Agency of Drug and Food Control ), the Ministry of Research and Technology, Padjadjaran University in Bandung, University of Indonesia in Jakarta, Airlangga University in Surabaya in East Java, and Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Central Java. “China’s Sinovac vaccine uses a single virus, which is bred and multiplied in the laboratory. It is then separated from its elements so that the virus becomes inactive and safe for human use. This inactivated virus is used as material for vaccine,” Amin said, but Merah-Putih uses only the spike protein characteristic of coronavirus and nucleocapsid protein as an antigen. “If the two elements of COVID-19, the spike protein and nucleocapsid, are put together in a ‘house’ of a mammal cell, they will become a vaccine that enhances human body immunity, particularly immunity against coronavirus,” Amin said, adding: “It is this combination of the two proteins that becomes antigen and will be injected in humans,” Amin explained. Minister of research and technology and chief of the National Research and Innovation Agency or BRIN, Bambang PS Brodjonegoro, said he wanted the Merah-Putih clinical trials to take place by early 2021. But Amin predicted his institution would be able to deliver material for the Merah-Putih vaccine to the pharmaceutical industry between February and March 2021 and carry out the first clinical trial by mid-2021. Bambang said work on the Merah-Putih vaccine is 40% complete. When fully completed, the vaccine candidate will first be tested on mammal cells before it goes to clinical trials. And if things go well, it will be ready for mass production. “If the clinical trials go well, we will be able to mass produce Merah-Putih by early 2022,” he said. Need for international collaborations While struggling to produce its own vaccine, Indonesia remains open to international partnerships and joint cooperation for further vaccine development. “We have to build our self-reliance in medicines. With a population of 270 million people, Indonesia cannot depend on imported medicines and drugs,” said Bambang. Indonesia relies heavily on imported medicines. More than 80% of its drug materials are imported. And more than 60% of them are from China, and a further 30% from India. This reliance on imported drug materials has become more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic caused Indonesia’s pharmaceutical industry to operate at 55% to 66% of capacity, according to the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20200915121452749
University World News,State university entrance exams held with strict protocols,11 July 2020,"INDONESIA State university entrance exams held with strict protocols The Jakarta Post 11 July 2020 Tweet As Indonesia scrambles to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, some 703,875 test-takers are trying to keep themselves together in order to earn a place in one of the country’s state universities, all while following strict health protocols that one expert has criticised as “misguided”, writes Ardila Syakriah for The Jakarta Post . Taking a computer-based exam (UTBK) is one of three ways high school graduates can earn one of the limited number of places offered at state universities in Indonesia, which has been trying to increase its university participation rate from the current 30.29%. The exams will be held in two batches, from 5-14 July and from 20-29 July at 74 test centres in cities across the country, including in the COVID-19 epicentres of Surabaya in East Java and Jakarta, with rooms at universities and schools being used as test venues. The Institution of University Entrance Exams (LTMPT) requires body temperature checks on site and has advised test-takers to wear masks, face shields and gloves. But some local administrations and universities are now requiring test-takers to also undergo a rapid antibody test before sitting the entrance exam. Epidemiologist Windhu Purnomo from Airlangga University said the test requirement was “confusing” and demonstrated a “misguided” understanding of the function of rapid tests.

University World News,National university ranking highlights quality challenge,7 September 2019,"INDONESIA National university ranking highlights quality challenge Kafil Yamin 07 September 2019 Tweet Indonesia’s higher education ministry has announced its latest ranking of the country’s universities in an effort to boost the quality of the universities under its management. The ranking is based on human resources quality, institutional quality, student performance, research and social services, and innovation. The scoring divides universities in Indonesia into five groups. Group one, the highest, in which institutions are regarded as centres of excellence, has 13 universities. Middle-ranking group two has 72 universities, while group three comprises 299 universities; group four has 1,470 universities and group five has 155. Within the top group, Bandung Institute of Technology is the top ranked university in the country, followed by Gadjah Mada University, Bogor Agricultural University, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, University of Indonesia, Diponegoro University, Airlangga University, Hasanuddin University, Brawijaya University, Padjadjaran University, Andalas University, Sebelas Maret University and the University of North Sumatra. The vast majority of these are in Java, which has raised questions about the quality gap between Java and other regions in Indonesia, particularly the eastern part of the country with just one institution on the top list – Hasanuddin University in Makassar, South Sulawesi province, according to Indonesia’s national news agency Antara News. Indonesia’s Minister of Research, Technology and Higher Education Mohamad Nasir said the ranking, which was announced on 16 August, is intended to improve university quality and inform high school graduates on their university choices. Nasir said he is lobbying Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo to provide an endowment fund of around IDR10 trillion (US$709 million) for universities that reach the top ranks, to increase funding for the top 13 for research and innovation. “We are working on the endowment fund allocation from the state budget. The fund will bring more research; higher quantity and quality research will make our universities more competitive,” Nasir said. Comparison with other rankings A ranking of Indonesian universities by Scimago , based on scholarly research citations using Scopus data, also produces a list with the top 10 universities being the University of North Sumatra, University of Indonesia, Bogor Agricultural University, Gadjah Mada University, Bandung Institute of Technology, Jenderal Soedirman University, Syiah Kuala University, Brawijaya University, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and Airlangga University. Despite the government’s big push for higher quality, none of Indonesia’s top universities in this national ranking is listed in the world’s top 100. In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the University of Indonesia is ranked in the 601-800 band, Bandung Institute of Technology in the 801-1000 band and Gadjah Mada University is ranked 1000+. Professor Dr Asep Saeful Muhtadi, senior lecturer and communication expert at the Surabaya-based Unitomo University, said: “The ranking by the research, technology and higher education ministry is credible enough for national standards, but it does not necessarily mean it is internationally accepted, because the standard and components of evaluations are very different.” Muhtadi pointed to the large budget gap between Indonesian universities and world-class universities. “Quality research needs a high budget; Indonesian universities just cannot afford it,” Muhtadi told University World News . Low research budgets He described a recent four-year research project from an Australian university for which he received funding, and which included three trips to Australia and one to Germany for a presentation. “Indonesian universities can barely finance such a research project,” he said, adding that low budgets lead to low research and scientific journal publications. The quantity of scientific journal publications determines the quality of universities. The number of professors in a university is related to research productivity, while the lecturer-student ratio is also an important international rankings indicator. “If a university has large numbers of students, it needs more lecturers. More lecturers require a higher budget; that’s the way it is,” Muhtadi said, adding that in top universities in Indonesia, the ratio is one lecturer for 30 students, while the ideal is 1:20. “The international standard is 1:8,” he noted. Yeni Huriani, senior lecturer of health and nursing at the Padjadjaran University, said: “The average budget for our research is around IDR50 million to IDR60 million [US$3,500-US$4,300] over two years. It includes everything.” In the past she received funding from the West Java administration for a research project on women’s empowerment among families in West Java. “I grappled with IDR50 million for two years of research and had my research results published in a scientific journal. I made it. But I don’t want to do it again. “Now I just give my regular lectures and live on my salary,” she told University World News . “And if all lecturers think the way I do, then forget about being a world-class university.”",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190905154816106
University World News,University ‘radicalisation’ ranking sparks debate,11 July 2019,"INDONESIA University ‘radicalisation’ ranking sparks debate Kafil Yamin 11 July 2019 Tweet Two developments – a recent survey of 10 state universities in Indonesia showing that religious teaching on their campuses could be increasing fundamentalist tendencies among students and a ranking of the universities according to strength of fundamentalism on campus – have unleashed a debate about universities’ role in religious extremism. The survey , based on 1,000 responses from the 10 universities was published on 2 July by the Setara Institute, which conducts research on political freedom and rights in Indonesia. It ranked the universities according to the perceived ‘strength’ of students’ fundamentalist views. Students at Bandung State Islamic University are deemed the ‘most fundamentalist’ according to the ranking. The Jakarta branch of the same university is ranked second, followed by the University of Mataram, Bogor Agricultural University and Yogyakarta State University. The study gauged student views on fundamentalism, conservatism, inclusion and religious violence. “Fundamentalism in religion can become the root of intolerance and radicalism,” said Noryamin Aini, a Setara Institute researcher. The 10 universities surveyed are University of Indonesia, Bogor Agricultural University, Bandung Institute of Technology, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta State University, University of Brawijaya, Airlangga University in Surabaya in East Java, University of Mataram, Jakarta State Islamic University and Bandung State Islamic University. The institute’s conclusions will be submitted to the government along with policy recommendations such as government monitoring of all state universities for religious fundamentalism, and moving compulsory religion courses at state universities from the first semester to the fifth to prevent new students being recruited by campus-based religious groups. Academics dispute the findings However, a number of academics disputed the findings. “I have been at this university since I was a student. Now I am a lecturer, I don’t see any clues whatsoever that we have a radical mindset,” said Taufiq Rahman, head of social and political studies at the Bandung State Islamic University. “All Islamic schools of thought exist here. They engage in various academic discourses and there have never been restrictions or intolerant acts or behaviour among lecturers or students,” he told University World News . Rahman noted that the university was often referred to as a ‘house of liberal Islam’, contrary to the survey’s alleged finding that it is among the most radicalised of the state institutions, and he criticised the research for its methodology and conclusions, particularly as it did not include direct observation, only a questionnaire. Nonetheless, Rahman described several of the members of Setara Institute as his friends. “As far as I know, they are very secular,” he added. Muhammad Rashid, physics lecturer at Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, said many things could be described as ‘radical’. “We have to have a common understanding [of the term] to keep the discussion going.” Associating radicalism only with religion, particularly Islam, is another problem. “We have radical ideas and thoughts which change the course of history. Why does it turn out to be a bad thing only in religion?” “In religion, sticking to principles and faith is a good thing, but non-religious people would call it radical,” he said. Directed at government critics Analysts said the claim that universities are associated with fundamentalism and radicalism is directed at lecturers and students who criticised a government decree disbanding certain religious organisations, and the arrests of religious leaders and opposition figures in order to silence government critics. Academic criticism against the government’s heavy-handed approach to social issues was triggered by the disbanding of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) in 2017, which the government said threatened the state ideology known as Pancasila . HTI has largely been a campus-based movement but is often regarded as non-violent. Rashid said some of the government’s accusations against HTI were “baseless and unclear”. “HTI was actually struggling to promote an alternative to the current system of politics and economy, which they [HTI] thought was a failure. They did it through education and public lectures, discussion. What’s wrong with that? Any group within society can promote their own ideas,” Rashid told University World News . He said he did not always agree with HTI ideas, “but I deal with them with reasoning”. A lecturer at Semarang State University, requesting anonymity, said she was reprimanded and forced to sign a ‘letter of loyalty’ or face suspension just for criticising the arrest of religious leaders on Facebook. “Now I use a pseudonym Facebook account,” she said, noting university authorities had told her she was under state intelligence agency monitoring. “So I am so terrified,” she said. As a lecturer at the university for 30 years, she says she ignored highly paid job offers from private corporations but despite her loyalty was “treated as the enemy of the state”. Suteki, a law professor at Diponegoro University in Central Java, was fired last year from the university after appearing as an expert witness at a trial which heard HTI’s appeal against the government ban. He had said the disbanding had “legal deficiencies”. Rashid said lecturers criticising the ban are often those who understand the law and are calling on those in power to comply. “And that’s what academics are supposed to do,” he said.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190711092154793
University World News,Ministry sets up task force on campus radicalisation,7 July 2018,"INDONESIA Ministry sets up task force on campus radicalisation Ria Nurdiani 07 July 2018 Tweet A new joint task force has been set by Indonesia’s Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education and the country’s National Counter-Terrorism Agency (BNPT) to develop guidelines to combat Islamic radicalism which appears to be gaining wider support on campuses. The task force would also set up procedures to ‘monitor and counter’ emerging radical thinking and behaviour among university students and lecturers. Although the exact role of the BNPT was not made clear, officials said the agency and universities needed to exchange intelligence. The announcement came after the ministry on 25 June summoned 122 heads of state universities and representatives of a government agency supervising private universities. Suhardi Alius, BNPT chief, and Haryomo Dwi Putranto, deputy of personnel management of the National Civil Service Agency, also joined the closed-door meeting. Indonesia’s Higher Education Mnister Mohamad Nasir expressed optimism that Indonesian universities could become “a bulwark against the spread of radicalism”. This is despite a view expressed by Nasir that the numbers exposed to radicalism on campuses is minor. “Currently we have more than seven million students, 200,000 lecturers and hundreds of thousands of higher educational staff throughout Indonesia. Radicalism is starting to infiltrate the campus, but the number is very small, a miniscule percentage of the total civitas academia,” the minister said in a statement on the meeting obtained by University World News . The meeting itself was in response to public concerns after the BNPT in early May said its confidential research had shown seven universities, including Indonesia’s top university, Universitas Indonesia (UI), are exposed to radicalism. They also include Bandung Institute of Technology, Airlangga University, Bogor Agricultural University, Diponegoro University, Institute of Technology Sepuluh Nopember and University of Brawijaya, according to the agency. It also said in its report that almost every state university in Java and Sulawesi has been exposed to radicalism, with science and medical sciences students the most likely to be exposed. Definition of radical However, the BNPT research has been called into question because of the secrecy surrounding how the information was gathered, sparking debate among academics and civil society groups. UI international relations lecturer Ali Abdullah Wibisono, an expert on responses to terrorism, said much was unclear about the BNPT’s report. “The definition of radical itself raised questions. Does radical mean only [adherence to an] ideology or involvement in an act of terror?” Other terrorism experts say exposure to extremist teachings did not necessarily lead to membership of a radical group or that students were likely to become involved in terrorist acts. UI has already said it will take firm action if students or lecturers are found to be involved in radicalism or are members of banned Islamic organisations such as Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia. Rifelly Dewi Astuti, UI’s head of public relations, told local media in early June that the university routinely monitors activities on campus and runs radicalism prevention schemes, beginning with the orientation of new students. But UI Rector Muhammad Anis has acknowledged that universities did not have the skills to identify radical movements or detect how they spread their ideology. Suicide-bombing attacks The government stepped up action to curb campus radicalisation in the wake of the suicide-bombing attacks targeting Christian Churches in the country’s second-largest city Surabaya, East Java, on 13 May, and in Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau province in Sumatra, on 16 May. The attacks, which killed over 14, were the most deadly Islamic terrorist attacks in Indonesia since 2005 in Bali. The issue of university recruitment by radical groups was heightened when three suspected terrorists were arrested on 2 June at the state University of Riau in Pekanbaru by the national police’s elite counter-terrorism unit known as Densus 88. All three suspects were alumni of the university. Police also said they had discovered two pipe bombs on the campus, allegedly to be used to target the Regional People's Representative Assembly, the local parliament in Riau, and the national parliament in Jakarta. However, even before the May attacks, an Indonesian State Intelligence Agency study this year reiterated that radical Islamic groups were targeting universities for new recruits to their cause. The intelligence agency’s head, Budi Gunawan, said in early May that it was closely monitoring three universities thought to be at risk of becoming a base for radical groups. The intelligence agency, in a survey conducted in 2017 but released only in April this year, suggested an estimated 39% of university students have been exposed to radical groups, with 15 provinces classified as “high risk” for students being targeted by such groups. Campus radicalism is not new, UI’s Ali told University World News . Hizbut Tahrir, the political movement originating from Palestine whose basic tenet is to set up an Islamic caliphate, began to be active in Indonesia in 1983 as Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). It organised seminars and training on campuses. GP Ansor, the youth organisation of Nahdlatul Ulama – Indonesia’s biggest Islamic organisation – began to openly express concern last year, saying HTI was a threat to Indonesia’s state ideology of Pancasila . The Ministry of Law and Human Rights finally revoked HTI’s organisation licence on 19 July 2017. Stepped up monitoring In the wake of the arrest of suspects at Riau University, the university and other universities imposed strict measures on campus activities. The University of North Sumatra in Riau’s neighbouring province imposed a ban on campus activities after 10pm “to anticipate anything related to radicalism”, Runtung Sitepu, the university’s rector, announced on 4 June. A similar curfew was announced at Hasanuddin University in Makassar, capital of South Sulawesi province. Nasir told local media his ministry would monitor social media on campuses in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. “We record data of lecturers and students as well. We keep a record of their cellular phones and track their social media presence,” he was quoted by Indonesia’s national news agency Antara as saying on 4 June. He insisted however that the ministry was not invading students’ privacy or restricting academic activities. New students would be asked to register their social media accounts at their universities, the ministry has said. The ministry will also conduct thorough background checks in collaboration with anti-corruption agencies on university rector candidates to prevent the development of radical sympathies on campuses, Nasir said in early June. This drew objections such as from Professor Firmanzah, rector of Paramadina University, who said “the minister should review the plan”, which would harm freedom of speech on campus and added that there were more effective ways to prevent radicalisation, such as community service for students. Lecturers dismissed Even before Nasir’s June remarks, social media monitoring was a key tool. In May this year, Dr Suteki, a law professor who headed the master of law programme at Diponegoro University, a public university in Semarang, Central Java, and who taught the principles of Pancasila for more than two decades, was dismissed from his position following an ethics code probe after it was alleged he expressed support for HTI on social media. He has denied any allegiance to HTI. A dean and three lecturers at the Institute of Technology Sepuluh Nopember, a public university in Surabaya, were also dismissed, allegedly on the same grounds. If proven to have violated the code, disciplinary punishment – from promotion postponement, dismissal from office to dishonourable discharge – will be imposed. Alamsyah Djafar, a researcher at the Wahid Foundation, which conducted a study on Islamic radicalisation published last year, told University World News it was more important to reduce the level of hatred. “No more hate speech. Discrimination on campus should immediately be handled by the university because almost all radical acts start from intolerance,” he said. A 2016 Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace survey revealed that 35.7% of the students surveyed showed a tendency to intolerance, 2.4% were involved in acts of intolerance, and 0.3% had the potential to become terrorists. The survey was based on 760 respondents who enrolled in public high schools in Jakarta and Bandung, West Java.

However, even before the May attacks, an Indonesian State Intelligence Agency study this year reiterated that radical Islamic groups were targeting universities for new recruits to their cause. The intelligence agency’s head, Budi Gunawan, said in early May that it was closely monitoring three universities thought to be at risk of becoming a base for radical groups. The intelligence agency, in a survey conducted in 2017 but released only in April this year, suggested an estimated 39% of university students have been exposed to radical groups, with 15 provinces classified as “high risk” for students being targeted by such groups. Campus radicalism is not new, UI’s Ali told University World News . Hizbut Tahrir, the political movement originating from Palestine whose basic tenet is to set up an Islamic caliphate, began to be active in Indonesia in 1983 as Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). It organised seminars and training on campuses. GP Ansor, the youth organisation of Nahdlatul Ulama – Indonesia’s biggest Islamic organisation – began to openly express concern last year, saying HTI was a threat to Indonesia’s state ideology of Pancasila . The Ministry of Law and Human Rights finally revoked HTI’s organisation licence on 19 July 2017. Stepped up monitoring In the wake of the arrest of suspects at Riau University, the university and other universities imposed strict measures on campus activities. The University of North Sumatra in Riau’s neighbouring province imposed a ban on campus activities after 10pm “to anticipate anything related to radicalism”, Runtung Sitepu, the university’s rector, announced on 4 June. A similar curfew was announced at Hasanuddin University in Makassar, capital of South Sulawesi province. Nasir told local media his ministry would monitor social media on campuses in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. “We record data of lecturers and students as well. We keep a record of their cellular phones and track their social media presence,” he was quoted by Indonesia’s national news agency Antara as saying on 4 June. He insisted however that the ministry was not invading students’ privacy or restricting academic activities. New students would be asked to register their social media accounts at their universities, the ministry has said. The ministry will also conduct thorough background checks in collaboration with anti-corruption agencies on university rector candidates to prevent the development of radical sympathies on campuses, Nasir said in early June. This drew objections such as from Professor Firmanzah, rector of Paramadina University, who said “the minister should review the plan”, which would harm freedom of speech on campus and added that there were more effective ways to prevent radicalisation, such as community service for students. Lecturers dismissed Even before Nasir’s June remarks, social media monitoring was a key tool. In May this year, Dr Suteki, a law professor who headed the master of law programme at Diponegoro University, a public university in Semarang, Central Java, and who taught the principles of Pancasila for more than two decades, was dismissed from his position following an ethics code probe after it was alleged he expressed support for HTI on social media. He has denied any allegiance to HTI. A dean and three lecturers at the Institute of Technology Sepuluh Nopember, a public university in Surabaya, were also dismissed, allegedly on the same grounds. If proven to have violated the code, disciplinary punishment – from promotion postponement, dismissal from office to dishonourable discharge – will be imposed. Alamsyah Djafar, a researcher at the Wahid Foundation, which conducted a study on Islamic radicalisation published last year, told University World News it was more important to reduce the level of hatred. “No more hate speech. Discrimination on campus should immediately be handled by the university because almost all radical acts start from intolerance,” he said. A 2016 Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace survey revealed that 35.7% of the students surveyed showed a tendency to intolerance, 2.4% were involved in acts of intolerance, and 0.3% had the potential to become terrorists. The survey was based on 760 respondents who enrolled in public high schools in Jakarta and Bandung, West Java.

University World News,Government to curb radicalism at universities,8 June 2018,"INDONESIA Government to curb radicalism at universities Jakarta Globe 08 June 2018 Tweet Higher Education Minister Mohamad Nasir announced a plan last week to meet with the heads of public universities towards the end of this month to coordinate efforts aimed at preventing radicalism on Indonesian campuses, reports the Jakarta Globe . “We will discuss ways to tackle radicalism and intolerance on campus, what the implementation would look like, and how rectors can help address the issue and coordinate their respective deans to approach the issue comprehensively,"" Nasir said, as reported by BeritaSatu .com. He added that rectors must conduct a thorough verification process on their alumni and pay close attention to those still active on campus. According to the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT), several public universities are exposed to radicalism. These include the University of Indonesia in Depok, West Java; Bandung Institute of Technology in West Java; University of Brawijaya in Malang, East Java; Diponegoro University in Semarang, Central Java; and Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java.

University World News,First foreign university expected to open this year,25 May 2018,"INDONESIA First foreign university expected to open this year Ria Nurdiani 25 May 2018 Tweet Indonesia will have at least one foreign university’s branch campus operating this year as the government finalises detailed regulations to allow them in as part of the country’s attempts to improve higher education performance. Other measures include pushing for some local universities to become ‘world-class’ by providing additional funding. However, it will not be a free-for-all for foreign providers. Opening up to foreign universities will be limited and will be a partnership with private universities in Indonesia. “It is not like the government has a vacancy for foreign universities to open a branch,” Patdono Suwignjo, director general for institutional development at the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, told University World News . “It is the government who is approaching the universities.” According to Patdono, foreign universities will first be screened according to their position in international rankings, such as the QS World University Rankings. Only universities ranked above 200 can make it onto the government’s list, he said. The government will determine where the universities can operate and which subjects can be offered under the collaboration. The priority is for subjects not available or yet to be developed in Indonesia, he said. Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, business and management have been mentioned as priority subject areas. “The government is hoping for at least one Australian university to open a branch this year,” Patdono said, but declined to name the institution. Previously the ministry had indicated that the University of Melbourne and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) had fulfilled the government's requirements. Earlier this year Muhammad Nasir, Indonesia's research, technology and higher education minister, told a press conference in Jakarta up to 10 universities were looking to take up the government’s offer “by the middle of the year”, and said two top Australian universities, the University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland, and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom had “expressed an interest” in operating in Indonesia. He has suggested that the “capital involvement” of foreign universities would be up to 67%. Employment of foreign academics To accelerate the process, the government issued Presidential Regulation No 20, 2018, in March on the employment of foreign workers to simplify procedures and make it easier for foreign lecturers, among others, to obtain work permits in Indonesia, although this has sparked concerns by local lecturers that they may compete with them for jobs. The government also announced last month that it was opening up opportunities for foreign academics to become permanent lecturers in Indonesian universities as part of its drive to push up standards, suggesting that some 200 foreign lecturers could be recruited. The ministry is currently preparing the supporting regulations, including the possibility of a new type of visa for academics. Currently, foreign lecturers are not permitted to reside permanently in the country. The government enacted a controversial law in 2012 allowing foreign universities to open a branch in Indonesia with government approval as long as they are not-for-profit, collaborate with Indonesian universities and emphasise the hiring of local lecturers. But the government appeared to be vacillating, with President Joko Widodo saying in February that he did not want to “hastily execute the plan” just in order to improve the quality of higher education but give local institutions a chance to improve first. On the other hand, the government spends huge amounts on scholarships for Indonesians to study abroad. But the entry of Australian universities will also depend on an Australia-Indonesia free trade agreement known as the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which is expected to be signed by August and includes foreign education providers and is likely to include foreign investment in education. Top five universities set to be world class President Widodo set a target when he took office in 2014 of making some Indonesian universities ‘world class’. Last month Nasir repeated the target of five ‘world-class’ Indonesian universities within the next two years. Indonesia’s top five universities, namely Universitas Indonesia, Bandung Institute of Technology, Gadjah Mada University, Airlangga University and Bogor Agricultural University, are targeted to become a world-class university by 2019. “Government wants their rank to be upgraded, at least above 200,” said Patdono. Based on the QS World University Rankings, Universitas Indonesia is ranked 277, while Bandung Institute of Technology is at 331, Gadjah Mada University is around the 401-410 mark, and Airlangga University and Bogor Agricultural University are ranked 701-750 and 751-800, respectively. Patdono said since 2016, these universities had been receiving additional funds of IDR10 billion (approximately US$708,500) a year per university to fulfil the QS world-class criteria. “The budget is for hiring more lecturers, research funding,” said Patdono, referring to the faculty to student ratio and research paper citations per faculty in the rankings criteria. Nonetheless Patdono admitted that in Indonesia “the disparity is so huge”, with universities outside Java island lagging. The government is trying to narrow the gap by providing additional funds to private universities on a competitive basis, he said. “The budget [of IDR1 billion per university] is not much; it is limited actually. But we hope it can improve the criteria related to world-class university assessments,” he said.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180525095732855
University World News,Higher education bill postponed after widespread opposition,19 April 2012,"INDONESIA Higher education bill postponed after widespread opposition Ria Nurdiani 19 April 2012 Tweet A controversial new higher education law has been shelved until at least August after its tabling in Indonesia’s parliament, expected in March, was postponed several times in recent weeks following widespread opposition. After a concerted campaign by student and education watchdog groups, as well as rejection from public and private university managers who said the bill was being rushed through with little consultation, the House of Representatives decided this month that it could not be tabled before August. Sources said the task force set up by a parliamentary committee to draft the bill would make changes, particularly to social clauses. Some 18 non-governmental organisations united as the National Committee for Education firmly rejected the draft bill, while student organisations in a dozen public universities across the country held demonstrations. “The bill is in contravention of the Constitution, which states that education is every citizen’s right,” Hamdan Ardiansyah, president of the student executive board of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (Indonesian University of Education) in Bandung, told local media at a 4 April demonstration. “There are articles that are detrimental to students and the community, especially poor people.” According to existing laws, public universities must accept economically disadvantaged students with high academic potential as 20% of new enrolments spread across all majors. But student groups fear that autonomy clauses in the new bill, allowing institutions to manage their own finances, could close off access for the poor as universities seek to ensure autonomous funding by raising tuition fees or accepting students more likely to pay. With the current draft “universities will accept students based on their economic class”, education expert Darmaningtyas, of the National Committee for Education, was quoted in local media as saying. Faldo Maldini, chair of the student executive board of Universitas Indonesia, told University World News that students “strongly reject” the bill’s articles on college autonomy. Since Universitas Indonesia had become a state-owned legal entity – the first university to do so under the 2008 Bill on Educational Legal Entities that sought to give universities autonomy to raise their own financial resources – it had begun to charge an admission fee, Maldini said. “We did not have admission fees before we changed our status, but now we have them.” Critics have said the drafting of the new bill was rushed, as the government attempted to replace the 2008 legal entities bill, which controversially had to be annulled after the Supreme Court said in April 2010 that it promoted the aggressive privatisation of higher education. The campaigners claim that the new draft bill is simply a rehash of the annulled bill, which they argue has led to the corporatisation of universities. Seven universities that turned into legal entities under the provisions of the bill before it was annulled, have seen their tuition fees soar. Vegas Dwipanegara, of the student executive board of Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya, told local media that since the university had changed its status from a public to a state-owned legal entity “education costs have risen about 80%”. Even private universities, which educate around two-thirds of Indonesian students in some 3,000 institutions, are not happy with the draft, as the majority of its provisions relate to public universities. “We need legal certainty,” said Edy Suandi Hamid, rector of the Islamic University of Indonesia, a private university in Yogyakarta. He is also head of the Indonesian Private Universities Association. Although private universities outnumber the country’s 88 public universities, the association feels that the government did not accommodate their interests in the draft bill. ""Many private universities face financial problems in order to comply with standards applied by the Education and Culture Ministry,” Edy told University World News . For example, the teacher-to-student ratio set by the ministry is 1:25 for science and 1:30 for social science. Even though there is some room for manoeuvre – up to 1:40 in science and 1:50 in social science – the ratios are difficult for some private universities to achieve. “There should be intervention from government and the opportunity for that could be in the bill,” Edy said.",https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20120419123336468

University World News,ISLAMIC STATES:  Network to improve quality assurance,28 June 2009,"ISLAMIC STATES: Network to improve quality assurance Wagdy Sawahel 28 June 2009 Tweet The Islamic States has approved the creation of a network for quality assurance and accreditation of higher education institutions to promote creativity, innovation and research and development. The network was proposed by Malaysia and announced at the 36th Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the 57 Member States of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, held in the Syrian capital Damascus late last month. It is intended to strengthen quality assurance of institutions in the Islamic region and to enhance cooperation between similar bodies in other regional and international organisations. Hassanuddeen Abd Aziz, head of a quality assurance unit in the faculty of economics and management sciences at the International Islamic University Malaysia, said the Islamic world urgently needed such a network to raise the level of its poor-quality universities. Aziz said that out of 1,700 universities in the Islamic world, only Istanbul University in Turkey was included in the top 500 in last year's academic ranking of world universities. He said that although many institutions from developing countries such as Mexico, Brazil, India, South Africa and Argentina were included in the top 500 in ranking of scientific papers, no single university from the 57 Islamic countries was mentioned. The entire Muslim world comprised one-fifth of humanity but had less than 1% of its scientists who generated less than 5 % of its science and made barely 0.1 % of the world's original research discoveries each year. The Islamic countries had a negligible percentage of patent registrations in the US, Europe and Japan. Even more serious was the fact that the R&D manpower of Muslim countries was only 1.18% of the total science and technology manpower. ""The Islamic world has recently launched a number of projects to reform universities,"" said Hassan Moawad Abdel Al, former President of Mubarak City for Scientific Research and Technology Applications in Alexandria in Egypt. These included a project titled ""achieving excellence in science and technology higher education"" that aimed at building and retaining a critical mass of world-class scientists and technologists in targeted science and technology areas, promoting relevant research and development outcomes as well as improving scientific, technological and innovative capacities of institutions.

Inside Higher Ed,Capacity and Quality,No Date,"You have / 5 articles left. Sign up for a free account or log in. Sign Up, It’s FREE Login Enrollments are booming, but the government can't find money to pay for new universities. Lawmakers want to know if taxpayers are getting value in their higher education systems while colleges fear excessive regulation. Private higher education -- much of it from for-profit entities -- is growing rapidly, and facing skepticism from traditional providers of higher education. It turns out that college presidents have a lot in common -- whether in the United States or Asia. A special session of the annual meeting of the American Council on Education Monday featured presentations from leaders of three Asian universities, who were asked to provide an overview of the changes that have been taking place and the difficulties facing institutions in their countries. Deepak Nayyar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University and former vice chancellor of the University of Delhi, said that he sees Indian higher education facing a ""quiet crisis,"" in which the rapid growth it is experiencing hides many significant problems. The failure of the government to expand universities to meet student need has led to ""higher education being privatized, de facto, on a massive scale,"" Nayyar said. This is especially the case in professional training, where over the last 15 years, the country has seen the percentage of students educated outside of the public sector grow from less than 15 percent to well over 50 percent. As Nayyar described the new private higher education sector, it bears little resemblance to private nonprofit colleges or to established for-profit entities in the United States. ""Quality is somewhat ambiguous,"" yet institutions can thrive because of what Indian educators call ""diploma disease"" -- the demand by students for a credential, even of dubious value, he said. It's not that there aren't plenty of government officials charged with overseeing higher education, Nayyar said, but they focus on the wrong things. Higher education in India, he said, is ""overregulated but undergoverned."" A related development, he said, is the huge growth in the number of Indian students who -- unable to find places at universities at home -- enroll at institutions abroad. While this is in many ways a natural extension of a long tradition of India's best and brightest heading to the Ivies or Oxbridge, Nayyar warned that these are different students. ""We are seeing a much larger exodus of less talented students than we've seen before,"" he said. Binglin Zhong, president of Beijing Normal University, also spoke of the need to balance growth with quality control. Zhong said that the rapid growth of recent years has prompted more interest from academics in evaluating both the quality of what students learn and of what professors teach. China is increasingly putting an emphasis not just on creating universities, but having them reach ""world class"" status, he said, adding to the interest in quality. Puruhito, rector of Airlangga University, in Indonesia, said that his country is engaged in a similar balancing act. Universities need more autonomy from the government, he said, to do better hiring, to plan new programs, and to avoid the corruption that is evident in parts of Indonesian society. At the same time, Puruhito said that there is more need for ""stake holders"" to have a sense of what higher education is accomplishing. Nancy E. Cantor, president of Syracuse University, moderated the session and urged her fellow American presidents to pay attention to the ""thriving, growing and changing"" higher education landscape in Asia. She said that interactions between American and Asian institutions ""used to be a one-way street"" and can't operate in that way any longer. That was a theme echoed by the panelists, when they were asked about the messages they have for American educational leaders. Nayyar said that American colleges should work with the many Indian academics in the United States or the American-educated professors back in India. Along these lines, he urged American colleges not to try to set up free-standing programs, on the model of American University in Beirut, but to pursue partnerships. Puruhito said Indonesian academe also has numerous faculty members -- on many campuses, a majority -- who have deep ties to American colleges. He said that he needed American colleges to not ""think about the financial differences"" between the countries. An American professor's salary is at least three times what Indonesia pays, limiting the ability to recruit, he said. Zhong summed up his thoughts on what Americans should think about in terms of international collaboration succinctly: ""It must be that both sides benefit.""
