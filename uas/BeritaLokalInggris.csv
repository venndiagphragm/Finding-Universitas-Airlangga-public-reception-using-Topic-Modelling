Jakarta Post;Airlangga University boasts of world's ‘first COVID-19 cure’, but experts urge caution;Airlangga University rector Muhammad Nasih has touted the potential coronavirus remedies the university is currently developing in collaboration with several state departments as “the first COVID-19 cure” in the world. Nasih said that the ongoing research and development – which is being conducted in partnership with the State Intelligence Agency (BIN) and the Indonesian Army – aimed to produce new, effective combinations of existing medicines to ameliorate the symptoms of COVID-19. “Of course, it will result in a new remedy that is expected to be the first COVID-19 cure in the world,” he told a press conference at the Indonesian Army headquarters in Jakarta on Saturday as quoted by tempo.co. He said three combinations of medications – lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin – had already undergone clinical trials.  “After we combined [different medicines], the rate of recovery [among test subjects] increased sharply. Certain combinations even reached 98 percent efficacy,” Nasih said. Army chief of staff Gen. Andika Perkasa, who was also at the press conference, said that he would meet with the head of the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) next week to officially request an accelerated approval process for the medications. But Maksum Radji, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Indonesia's (UI) School of Pharmacy, has urged the public to contain their optimism until an official report on the remedies’ efficacy is released. “The result of the clinical trials has yet to be published in any scientific journals, so it’s difficult to assess the efficacy and risks inherent in the use of the three combinations of medicines,” he told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. He added that such combinations of medications were not the first of their kind in the world, nor were they new inventions, citing similar developments in several other countries and pointing out that the three combinations had been included on the list of potential COVID-19 remedies currently undergoing clinical trials initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside remdesivir and interferon beta. “Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine […] are known to have triggered heart abnormalities in certain patients,” Maksum said. This is not the first time a state institution has claimed to have found a cure for COVID-19. In May, the Agriculture Ministry said it had developed eucalyptus-based coronavirus treatments, including an “antivirus necklace”, before backtracking on the claims last month, following widespread public criticism.;
Jakarta Post;Clinical trial of Airlangga University's 'first COVID-19 cure' not yet valid: Drug agency;"T he Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) has said potential COVID-19 remedies being developed by Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java, require additional clinical trials. BPOM head Penny Kusumawati Lukito said that upon inspecting the clinical trial of the drug -- developed in collaboration with the Indonesian Army and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN) -- on July 28, the agency found several critical findings that affected the test’s validity. According to the agency, the clinical trials had not fulfilled the BPOM’s protocols in randomizing the test subjects, including symptom severity variations. “The research needs to be conducted at random to better represent the Indonesian population,” Penny said Wednesday. The tested drug was also administered to COVID-19 asymptomatic patients, whereas the BPOM’s protocol stated that tested drugs should be given to patients with mild, moderate and severe symptoms. Penny added that the trial showed no significant results, with the drug’s effects being similar to existing remedies used to treat COVID-19 patients. The BPOM also called for the researchers to note possible side effects in future tests, given that the drug contained combinations of a number of potent medications.

Nasih previously touted the potential drug in development as ""the first COVID-19 cure"" in the world. It contained combinations of existing medicines, namely lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Health experts, however, urged the public not to get their hopes up, as the three combinations had been included on the list of potential COVID-19 remedies undergoing clinical trials initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO). While the research team had not responded to the BPOM’s report, Penny said Army chief of staff Gen. Andika Perkasa had acknowledged the agency's findings as he supported efforts to continue clinical trials and ensure the drugs' efficacy. Separately, BIN’s deputy head of communication and information, Wawan Hari Purwanto, said the research and development team was committed to following up on the BPOM's recommendation. “We have yet to convey any new development because we need time to make the required corrections,” Wawan said on Wednesday. “We are always in touch [with the BPOM] because we cannot proceed to the next stages if we do not fulfill their requirements.” The research team hoped to finish the drug as soon as possible in accordance with existing protocols. Penny added that it was common for drug research to receive corrections from the BPOM before it passed and received the distribution license.

Jakarta Post;Airlangga University expels student over 'sexual mummification' of multiple victims;"A irlangga University (Unair) in Surabaya, East Java, has officially expelled a student who had reportedly tricked multiple victims into performing an act known as “bondage mummification” under the pretense of academic research. In a statement published on Wednesday, the university acknowledged that the accused student, Gilang, had committed sexual assault on the victims. Prior to his expulsion, the Unair rector, Mohammad Nasih, and its ethics committee had conducted an online meeting with Gilang's family, in which the latter admitted his actions and expressed regret. The case, which gained public attention after several first-person accounts of the allegations made the rounds on Twitter, had tarnished the university's reputation, said the rector. ""We think this case [involving] G has caused immense damage to Unair's reputation as a state university that upholds excellence with moral values,"" Nasih said, referring to Gilang by his initial, in a statement posted on Unair's official website. Last week, multiple victims had taken to Twitter to share their accounts of being tricked by Gilang, who was enrolled at Unair's School of Cultural Sciences, into performing sexual mummification acts. One user with the handle @m_fikris wrote that he and his friend agreed to participate in Gilang's thesis ""research"" about ""wrapping"" in July after Gilang persistently begged him, saying he was at risk of failing his studies for not finishing his thesis. Gilang was in his fifth year of university. Read also: UII students disappointed at clearing of former student accused of sexual abuse Gilang sent instructions for @m_fikris and his friend to take turns covering each other’s bodies, including their mouths and eyes, with duct tape. He also instructed them to wrap their bodies in jarik (traditional Javanese cloth) and later asked them to record the process and to send him the footage afterward. A second victim, who requested anonymity, told The Jakarta Post that Gilang stripped him naked and sexually assaulted him after wrapping him in cloth in his rooming house last year. Another victim who spoke to the Post said that when they were both university freshmen, Gilang had drugged him, covered his entire body with a blanket, and groped him when he was sleeping at Gilang's rooming house after a university event in 2015. ""I confronted [Gilang] the next day, and he admitted all his actions,” said the victim. After the case garnered public attention, Unair established an information center for victims who wanted to report their cases and has prepared counseling services for victims. Nasih went on to say that the decision to expel Gilang was taken after considering several factors including the accounts of the victims, who felt ""abused"" and had their ""human dignity degraded"" by his actions. ""We have also considered the clarification from Gilang's family,"" he said, adding that the latter had fully accepted the university's decision. The university would hand over the legal proceedings in the case to the authorities, Nasih added.";

Jakarta Post;Visiting Korea, Airlangga promotes strategic bilateral ties;"B ilateral cooperation between Indonesia and South Korea has been established for over 50 years. The close relationship between the two countries continues to be promoted, especially in the sectors of economy, trade and investment. South Korea ranked as the seventh largest investor in Indonesia in 2023, with an investment value of US$2.5 billion. This represents an increase of $200 million, 8.70 percent, from 2022. Meanwhile, the total bilateral trade value between Indonesia and South Korea reached US$20.8 billion in 2023. To strengthen economic cooperation between Indonesia and South Korea, Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto visited South Korea on Monday to hold bilateral meetings with the South Korean government and business leaders. During his visit, Minister Airlangga met with South Korean business leaders to discuss cooperation opportunities in the automotive, electronics, semiconductor and hydrogen fuel development sectors in Indonesia. The cooperation between the two countries is continuously enhanced to foster innovative solutions for the future economies of both nations. In a meeting with the CEO of LG CNS, Shingyoon Hyun, in Seoul on Monday, Airlangga expressed his appreciation to LG CNS for signing a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with Sinar Mas Group to establish a joint venture in data center management and information and communication technology (ICT) services, which is targeted to be completed by the second half of 2024.

Jakarta Post;Former university student faces charges over ‘bondage mummification;"A former student of Airlangga University (Unair) accused of sexually assaulting multiple victims after tricking them into helping him for academic ""research"" is facing multiple charges at the Surabaya District Court in East Java. In a hearing held virtually on Wednesday, prosecutors indicted the 22-year-old defendant, identified only as Gilang, with three different charges. Prosecutor I Gede Willy said Gilang had violated articles 27 and 45 of the 2016 Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law, which prohibits individuals from sharing videos or other electronic information containing extortion or threats. Gilang was also charged under Article 82 of the 2016 law on child protection for allegedly threatening minors into performing obscene acts and Article 289 of the Criminal Code on obscenity, which carries a maximum sentence of nine years in prison. The defendant did not file an exception request against the charges. His case gained nationwide attention in August after several victims took to Twitter to share their alleged accounts of being tricked by Gilang into performing an act referred to as “bondage mummification” under the pretense of academic research. One user with the handle @m_fikris wrote that he and his friend agreed to participate in his thesis ""research"" about ""wrapping"" in July after Gilang persistently begged him, saying he was at risk of failing his studies for not finishing his thesis. The defendant was in his fifth year of university at that time. Gilang reportedly sent instructions for @m_fikris and his friend to take turns covering each other’s bodies, including their mouths and eyes, with duct tape. He also instructed them to wrap their bodies in jarik (traditional Javanese cloth) and later asked them to record the process and to send him the footage afterward. Another victim who spoke to The Jakarta Post said that when they were both university freshmen, the defendant had drugged him, covered his entire body with a blanket and groped him when he was sleeping at Gilang's rooming house after a university event in 2015. Unair expelled Gilang shortly after the case went viral. The defendant told police investigators that he had conducted such actions since 2015, claiming that he developed the fetish as a child.";
Jakarta Post;Preventing misleading claim of COVID-19 cure;R esearchers at Airlangga University (Unair) and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN) released on June 12 what appeared to be an encouraging statement: the discovery of five combination drug therapies and two stem cell therapies for treating COVID-19. The acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has claimed at least 2,000 lives in Indonesia to date. The joint statement attributed to Unair and BIN also said that the medicines were ready for distribution in treating COVID-19 patients.   Drug combinations The five combination therapies for COVID-19 are: lopinavir/ritonavir with azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir with doxycycline, lopinavir/ritonavir with clarithromycin, hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine with doxycycline. In addition, the statement claimed that the researchers had identified two types of isolated stem cells that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 activity: hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Their goodwill to bring an end to the pandemic should be appreciated. Unfortunately, their conclusions seem premature and could lead to more damaging consequences for the public. In theory, the drug combinations recommended by Unair and BIN have the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Lopinavir and ritonavir are protease inhibitors that are currently used to treat people with HIV/AIDS. Hydroxychloroquine is a malarial treatment, while azithromycin, doxycycline and clarithromycin are antibiotics that can fight secondary bacterial (not viral) infections in COVID-19 patients who have developed pneumonia. However, theory does not necessarily work in practice. None of these drugs have been proven in any clinical study to be a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) has started clinical trials involving thousands of patients in dozens of countries to test the efficacy and safety of these drugs. So far, there has been no clear indication that these drugs, whether individually or in combination, are effective in treating COVID-19. In fact, evidence exists that hydroxychloroquine may worsen the condition of patients, which led the WHO to suspend the clinical trial of the drug. Unair and BIN are correct in conducting in vitro (test tube) experiments to verify the effect and toxicity of the drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, they have not communicated in any clear way on how they designed, executed and analyzed their experiments. We do not know how they cultured the virus, what kind of negative controls they used, what kind of cells they tested or whether the cells they used contained the necessary receptors for SARS-CoV-2 to enter a human cell. More importantly, it is crucial to note that the results of in vitro experiments (however encouraging) cannot be assumed to be safe and effective treatments for direct use in human patients. For example, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on average approved less than 10 percent of drugs that performed well in vitro as safe for human prescription. The human lungs contain millions of cells comprising dozens of different types that perform intricate interactions. The proposed drugs can also affect other organs in the human body and cause adverse reactions. Instead of announcing that these five combination therapies are ready for treating COVID-19, Unair and BIN should first run a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to confirm their findings. Recruiting diverse patient populations is also critical to ensuring the fairness and robustness of the study. Despite their good intentions, all the drugs that Unair and BIN researchers have proposed are “strong” medicines, whether individually or in combination, that can potentially cause unwanted side effects and even death. Surely none of us want to rush into an unproven treatment in order to avoid developing even more overwhelming health problems in the future.   Stem cell therapy Stem cell therapy is another COVID-19 treatment that Unair and BIN researchers have proposed. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that has the potential to develop into many different types of cells in human body. One type of stem cell they have proposed is hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which develop into blood cells, including immune cells that help the body fight pathogens and infections. However, stem cell therapy is still considered very risky, expensive and limited to treating a few cancers, such as leukemia. No evidence exists that stem cell therapy is efficient in treating viral infections in the human body such as COVID-19. As with the drug therapies, the Unair and BIN researchers did not say how they performed their stem cell experiment. We have no information on crucial aspects like stem cell culturing protocol, the stem cell's differentiation status, tumorigenic potential, proliferation capacity or excretion patterns, and how they tested stem cell activity against SARS-CoV-2. Even if the researchers established a sound experimental protocol for their in vitro experiments, administering stem cell therapy to COVID-19 patients is an extremely dangerous procedure that can result in undesirable costs, such as malignancy, the stem cells attacking other healthy cells and possibly death. Injecting stem cells into the human body carries a huge risk of immuno-rejection (think of a blood type A patient receiving a blood type B infusion, but with a much more severe reaction). The doctors administering the treatment must isolate autologous stem cells from the individual patient or allogenic stem cells from a separate donor, culture them, and reinject the treated cells into the patient. These processes are extremely laborious, time-consuming and expensive, and there is no clear indication that the treatment will produce a safe and successful outcome against viral infection. This is hardly a sound strategy to use during a pandemic. Furthermore, the common procedure is to administer powerful immunosuppressants to reduce the strength of the patient’s immune system, particularly in the allogenic scenario, which would minimize the risk of immuno-rejection. However, it would be unwise to shut down a COVID-19 patient's immune system that is needed to work properly for their body to fight SARS-CoV-2. Unair and BIN's valiant efforts should still be applauded, as they are committed to treating COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. The public is waiting impatiently for the health crisis to subside so they can resume their normal lives. However, everyone should realize that discovering treatments and developing a potential vaccine for a disease that was virtually unknown six months ago takes a lot of time and resources. Unair and BIN said that they had submitted their research to at least seven peer-reviewed international journals, but this does not mean that their research is validated immediately. It still needs reviewing and questioned by their scientific peers. It is necessary for the researchers to publish their findings on an open access, preprint repository for biological or medical research papers like BiorXiv or MedrXiv, so that scientists and people around the world can scrutinize and engage in healthy scientific discourse. We absolutely deserve good news during the pandemic on safe medical treatments and vaccines. We also deserve complete, clear and transparent public communications from all COVID-19 stakeholders, including researchers and governments, to ensure that all actions are evidence-based, safe and effective.;
Jakarta Post;Surabaya student investigated for so-called ‘sexual mummification’ of multiple victims;Content warning: This story contains information about sexual assault that may be disturbing to some readers. Authorities are investigating allegations that a student at Airlangga University (Unair) in Surabaya, East Java, sexually assaulted multiple people after several first-person accounts of the allegations went viral on Twitter. The accused student, Gilang, allegedly tricked his victims into performing an act known as “bondage mummification” under the pretense of academic research. The case garnered public attention after a Twitter user with the handle @m_fikris gave an account of his encounter with Gilang, who allegedly claimed to be looking for a research subject for his thesis about “wrappings”. The user wrote that Gilang persistently begged him to take part in the research, saying he was at risk of failing his studies for not finishing his thesis. Gilang was in his fifth year of university. “I felt sorry, so I agreed to help. He told me that the research subject needed to be wrapped from head to toe so they could show emotions such as anxiety. [At first] I refused, but he convinced me that it was totally safe,” @m_fikris wrote. Gilang sent instructions for @m_fikris and his friend to take turns covering each other’s bodies, including their mouths and eyes, with duct tape. He also instructed them to wrap their bodies in jarik [traditional Javanese cloth]. Gilang asked them to record the process and to send him the footage afterwards. Another victim, who requested anonymity, said Gilang had asked him to visit his boarding house to help with his “research” last year. He said Gilang wrapped him in cloth, stripped him naked and sexually assaulted him. “The incident has traumatized me for the last eight months.

The 19-year-old college freshman from Surabaya had initially agreed to help Gilang with his research. “As Gilang was not in Surabaya because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he asked me to carry out the wrapping process with one of his relatives and send him pictures and videos of the process,” the 19-year-old said. He met Gilang’s “relative”, a high school student who, he discovered, had been blackmailed by Gilang into participating in the so-called research. A third victim, a 24-year-old, said he had been assaulted by Gilang in 2015 when they were both university freshmen. While he was sleeping at Gilang’s boarding house after a university event, he said he could feel Gilang cover his body with a blanket and grope him. “Strangely, I could not move at that time. I suppose he had drugged me. I confronted him the next day, and he admitted all his actions,” said the victim.

Suko added that the school’s ethics commission and the Surabaya Police were investigating the allegations against Gilang, including those filed several years ago. “I cannot say much because we haven’t been able to contact Gilang yet. However, we would expel him if he was found guilty of committing the sexual harassment [that he has been accused of] as it would be a serious violation,” the spokesperson said. Suko said no faculty members had received any prior reports but that he was looking into the matter further. The FIB has established an information center for victims who want to report their cases and has prepared counseling services for victims.;
Jakarta Post;Surabaya museum of death highlights Indonesian funeral traditions;"A museum in the East Java city of Surabaya aims to enlighten people about Indonesian funeral rituals and their correlation to other fields, including the economy and culture. The Ethnography Museum and Death Studies Center is located at Airlangga University’s (Unair) School of Social and Political Sciences in Surabaya. Upon entering the museum, people may smell a certain scent that may remind them of kemenyan (incense). But Toetik Koesbardiati, the museum’s management head, told The Jakarta Post that it was actually aromatherapy. “We use it to protect the museum from bad smells,” Toetik said. “We also use incense sticks, but not for rituals to summon spirits.” FROM THE WEEKENDER The case for Gen Z: What we want isn’t much, it’s realistic Blamed for being entitled, praised for being bold, Gen Z is just trying to survive in the grim economy they inherited. Read on The Weekender A replica of a funeral ritual in Trunyan village, Bali. (Museum of Ethnography and Center for Death Studies/File) Built in 2005, the museum mostly uses infographics to enlighten visitors about funeral ceremonies. It provides replicas as well, among them are funeral rites in Trunyan village, Bali and Toraja, South Sulawesi. Some people refer to the museum as a haunted house because it has one room with an imitative pocong(shrouded ghost) in it. “People are shrouded when they are buried in the Islamic way. We added pocong as a reflection that one day we’ll be dead and treated like that,” Toetik said. In the same room, there are books and research on death, the afterlife and other related topics. “These books show that death is often explored as a specific topic, but many people still avoid talking about it,” said Toetik. An imitative 'pocong' (shrouded ghost) on display is among reasons why some people call the museum a haunted house. (Museum of Ethnography and Center for Death Studies/File) Nestled in a two-story building, the museum has mock-up crime scene, jelangkung (a traditional medium used when summoning spirits) and types of graves based on different religions in Indonesia. There is also a collection of real human skeletons kept in a glass case. On one side, it displays collections of skeleton sculptures themed ""My lifestyle determines my death style"", meaning that visitors can learn about someone’s lifestyle from their remains. In forensic science, skeletons can hint about people’s sex, height, disease and other information about their identity when they were alive. “For instance, we can find out that someone is a saxophone player from their teeth structure,” said Toetik.

Furthermore, for its unique approach, the museum was awarded with Purwakalagrha by the Indonesia Museum Awards 2018. A mock-up crime scene at the museum. (Museum of Ethnography and Center for Death Studies/File) “People seldom talk about death, while they try so hard to stay alive because they’re afraid of dying. In biology, death is natural because this body isn’t getting younger,” Toetik said. “In reality, our culture has many celebrations of death. I call it ‘celebration’ because it requires a lot of money and people. It implies that death holds special place in our culture. That’s what we’re trying to portray [in our museum], although our limited space cannot fit [for all funeral ceremonies] from across Indonesia.” Managed under the university’s Anthropology program, the museum aims to show that death is never simple. “Death is related to other aspects, one of them is economy. Some funeral ceremonies aren’t inexpensive – in Bali we have ngaben and in Java we have other rituals following the burial procession,” said Toetik. “Death also creates other economy aspects, such as funeral home and mortuary makeup artist, hence death is not the end, but it’s the beginning. It gives room for us to learn about it.” The museum is open Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (kes)";
Jakarta Post;Med school head dismissal raises alarm on worsening academic freedom;T he dismissal of a medical school dean in Surabaya, East Java, allegedly for his criticism of the government’s plan to allow foreign doctors to open practice in Indonesia has raised the alarm on the condition of the country’s academic freedom. The Health Ministry recently pushed a plan to invite foreign doctors to make up for medical staff shortages in Indonesia, as allowed in the Health Law enacted last year. As part of the plan, the ministry issued a letter on June 9 announcing the need for foreign doctors in the hospitals it managed. But the plan met opposition from various parties, including Airlangga University’s medical school dean Budi Santoso, who told the media on June 27 that 92 medical schools across the country were able to produce graduates with the same quality as the foreign talent. Not long after he made the statement, Budi was fired from his position as dean, raising speculation that his dismissal was related to his public comments against the Health Ministry’s foreign doctor plan. The former dean claimed that he was summoned by the university’s rectorate on July 1 to clarify his intentions behind the statement. “The rector and I have a different opinion [regarding the foreign doctor plan]. I was declared to have a different stance, then I accepted the rector’s decision,” Budi said on Wednesday, as quoted by tempo.co;
Jakarta Post;COVID-19 takes toll on resident doctors;T wo resident doctors from Airlangga University (Unair) in Indonesia’s COVID-19 epicenter – Surabaya, East Java – had been on track to wrap up years of studies in the next few months.   However, following days of intensive treatment at their teaching hospital Dr. Soetomo Hospital, where they had been training and tending to patients for years, they succumbed to COVID-19.   Internal medicine chief resident Miftah Fawzy Sarengat died from the virus on June 10 after tending to COVID-19 patients in Surabaya, marking the first fatality reported among residents in Indonesia.   Less than a month later, on Sunday, pediatric resident Putri Wulan Sukmawati died from the virus, though Dr. Soetomo Hospital, also a COVID-19 referral hospital, insisted that she did not work in a COVID-19 isolation room and that the management was already “contact tracing internally”.   “At the hospital, there is no space that is safe from COVID-19. Even if we do not work in the COVID-19 [isolation] room, we can be infected by our colleagues,” an Unair resident, who requested anonymity, told The Jakarta Post on June 23.   He said that, up until May, the teaching hospital had failed to provide enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for residents working in the emergency room, prompting them to rely on PPE donations. It was only in June, after reports caught the public’s attention, that the hospital allowed residents in the ER to ask for a new set of PPE every four hours, he said.   “There is much worry among fellow residents. It is not only about fears of contracting the virus and potentially infecting family members at home, but also about prolonging our education, whether we want it or not,” he said.   “Adding one more semester means paying tuition fees for one more semester and more living costs for six more months.”   Seventeen universities in Indonesia offer residency programs with an estimated 13,000 students, according to the Academy of Medicine of Indonesia (MKKI), the Indonesian Medical Association’s (IDI) council overseeing medical education.   These residents are assigned to teaching hospitals, many of which are being used as COVID-19 referral hospitals. They work long hours with little to no pay, and when they do receive a salary it is way below the living wage. Indonesia’s university-based system for its residency programs meant that residents were considered university students who had to pay tuition fees, said MMKI chairman David Perdanakusuma.   The fees range from millions to dozens of millions of rupiah, although there are scholarship options, with the programs lasting four to 12 semesters.   This is in contrast to the hospital-based system used in other countries, in which residents are considered workers who receive salaries throughout their training.   “One of the ways to be able to survive being a resident is to be rich,” the Unair resident joked, adding more seriously that being a resident might not only lead to financial constraints, but also physical and mental issues.   A 2011 research study that polled 117 University of Indonesia pediatric residents at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta found that 23.9 percent of students had experienced depression two weeks prior to their interviews.   The study, published in Sari Pediatri, a journal from the Indonesian Pediatric Society’s (IDAI) publishing agency, also found that 59 percent of them had experienced depression more than once, with a majority of them relating it to their programs of study.   As a result of the pandemic, some residents of pulmonology, internal medicine and anesthetics, among other fields, have been asked to directly tend to COVID-19 patients in ERs, wards and intensive care units under the supervision of specialist doctors.   Hospitals and medical workers have had to limit services to non-COVID-19 patients, who have declined in number over virus fears, and reduce polyclinic activities and elective surgeries.   This has disrupted training for residents, as they have been less exposed to cases that would help them meet the required competencies to complete their studies, David of the MKKI said.   A resident at Brawijaya University in Malang, East Java, who wished to remain anonymous, said his teaching hospital of Saiful Anwar had seen a “boom” of COVID-19 patients, meaning there was a high possibility of prolonged training.   “[Hospital] departments are now requesting tuition fee relief [...] We are certainly financially concerned because we rely on our own money and scholarships, and we cannot work [while undertaking a residency],” he said on Sunday.   Joni Wahyuhadi, the president director of Dr. Soetomo Hospital and curative management head of East Java’s COVID-19 task force, told the Post on June 26 that the hospital made sure there was an adequate stock of PPE and that it was processing financial assistance for residents. He said it was also restructuring its ER.   At the time, he said nine residents were being treated for COVID-19 at the hospital, with one admitted to the ICU. On Monday, Joni said one resident was treated for the disease at his hospital and three others at Unair’s infectious diseases hospital. Joni did not respond to questions on the total number of infections among residents.   Unair has promised a 50 percent cut in tuition for residents providing care to COVID-19 patients. It has also waived their tuition while they take temporary leaves of absence from their study programs.   Meanwhile, David said the government had now rolled out financial assistance programs for residents via teaching hospitals, which were expected to register residents with the Workers Social Security Agency (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) to access the benefits.   “There is a possibility for a hospital-based residency system. Consequently, there needs to be an adequate teaching staff and hospitals that meet the teaching requirements,” he said.   “There also needs to be support [from policymakers] in the form of regulations and laws on the inception of hospital-based systems.” ;
Jakarta Post;Indonesian students reach highest North American peak;Three Indonesian students from Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java, have made it to the top of Denali in Alaska. Denali, the original native name of Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain peak in North America. The students, Muhammad Faishal Tamimi, Mochamad Roby Yahya and Yasak, reportedly reached the 6,164-meter-high Denali summit on Thursday morning. The trio departed from Indonesia on May 16 and spent 21 days climbing the mountain. Read also: Italians are first couple to reach world's highest summits To reach the peak, the students had to face several obstacles, such as snowstorms, narrow slopes and extreme cold weather, while carrying 50-kilogram packs of supplies comprising food, oxygen and special equipment. Prior to the trip, all three had to go through intensive training, which included running for one-and-a-half hours at a time and climbing several mountains in East Java. Airlangga Indonesia Denali Expedition (Aidex) manager Wahyu Nur Wahid told tempo.co that the Airlangga University’s mountaineering club had been planning to climb Denali since 1994.

Jakarta Post;Tahir calls on fellow tycoons to join his philanthropic ways;"C span class=""caption"">Congratulations: Dato Sri Tahir (second left), is congratulated by Attorney General HM Prasetyo (center) on being bestowed an economic doctorate degree by Airlangga University in Surabaya on Thursday.(JP/Wahyoe Boediwardhana) “Big wealth comes with big responsibility. Philanthropy is not mere alms, but a lifetime commitment.” That sentence was displayed on a big screen in a hall at Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java, on Thursday. It is a quote from tycoon and philanthropist Dato Sri Tahir, which he abides by when engaging in philanthropy. The founder of diversified Mayapada Group gave a speech during an event held by the university to honor him with an honorary doctorate for his contribution to the country’s economic development, his fourth honor so far. Tahir, who was on Wednesday named the fourth-richest man in Indonesia by Forbes magazine, called on his fellow magnates to realize their pivotal roles in the country’s development. Businesspeople should not only engage in the investment climate but also ease the government’s weight in many other sectors such as education, health and employment, he said. “Those are some of the responsibilities that we must take as moguls because we have enjoyed all the facilities. Businesspeople should not only enjoy the benefits,” Tahir said on the sidelines of the event. The 65-year-old founder of the Tahir Foundation delivered an academic speech highlighting Indonesia’s economic potential to compete on a global level. In his speech, the Surabaya-born Tahir said in order to achieve, the government needed to give incentives to companies and consumers using renewable energy in various industries. Speaking to journalists, the son-in-law of property and banking mogul Mochtar Riady said he would help Airlangga University forge cooperation with other universities overseas to boost Indonesia’s competitiveness in the higher education sector. Tahir is one of Indonesia’s leading philanthropists, having been involved in many various social organizations and public charities. He has donated more than US$100 million to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2014 to support efforts to combat major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, polio and malaria. Through the Tahir Foundation, he has also donated a total of $14 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2016 to support education and facilities for refugee children. The foundation’s latest donation was $250 million to be disbursed within five years for public empowerment programs in cooperation with Gadjah Mada University and Muhammadiyah, the country’s second-biggest Muslim organization, earlier this month. For Tahir, who, according to Forbes magazine is worth $3.5 billion, he did not think about how much money he would donate to good causes. “It will not be a problem if I hand over all of my wealth for the welfare of Indonesia. I come from a less fortunate family and I have experienced it all,” he said. He also plans to visit Jordan and Iraq this month with his foundation to give aid and visit refugees staying in shelters. As the first eminent advocate from Asia for the UNHCR, he also plans to help Syrian refugees get back on their feet by providing microloans for those who were stripped from their source of income due to the prolonged war. Airlangga University rector Muhammad Nasih commended Tahir for his generosity and contribution to the country. “If only there were 10 conglomerates having commitment like Tahir, I am sure it would be easier for us to reach social equality,” he said. Besides the university’s top officials, the event was also attended by top ministers such as Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan, Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita, Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto, Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi, Manpower Minister Hanif Dakhiri and Attorney General HM Prasetyo.";
Jakarta Post;Airlangga discusses digital trends, low-carbon economic growth with Silicon Valley CEOs;"A s part of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo's working visit to Stanford University on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in San Francisco, the United States, Jokowi held a meeting with CEOs from major companies in Silicon Valley. At The CEO of the Silicon Valley – Luncheon event at Stanford University Campus, Palo Alto, on Thursday, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto representing President Jokowi delivered a keynote speech and held discussions with Silicon Valley CEOs. CEOs in attendance included Scott Cook (founder and chairman of Intuit, director of eBay and Procter & Gamble), Julia D Hartz (cofounder and CEO of Eventbrite), Javier Olivan (COO of Meta), Jeff Williams (COO of Apple), Bret Taylor (Silicon Valley AI entrepreneur; former co-CEO of Salesforce and former chairman of Twitter), Drew Houston (board member of Facebook, cofounder and CEO of Dropbox), Divesh Makan (founder of ICONIQ Capital, LLC), Tim Dattels (partner of TPG and chairman of TPG Asia), along with Arun Majundar (dean of Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability) and John Hennessy (chairman of Alphabet; president emeritus of Stanford University from 2000 to 2016). During his speech, Airlangga said the event was extraordinary because of the CEOs in attendance, with those in attendance representing a market capitalization of US$7.3 trillion, or the equivalent of around six times Indonesia's GDP of $1.3 trillion. In comparison, the largest GDP of the Group of 20 members is held by the US at $25.46 trillion, followed by China at $17.96 trillion. Airlangga also noted the outlook for global economic growth, which was revised down to 3 percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in 2024. High inflation and tightening liquidity will still put pressure on global financial conditions, while slowing Chinese growth and rising geopolitical tensions will slow the world trade performance. Amid global uncertainty and a slowdown, he continued, Indonesia's economic fundamentals are still good with strong economic growth compared with other countries. Prospects Every Monday With exclusive interviews and in-depth coverage of the region's most pressing business issues, ""Prospects"" is the go-to source for staying ahead of the curve in Indonesia's rapidly evolving business landscape. View More Newsletter By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Privacy Policy SIGN UP Indonesia was able to maintain growth of around 5 percent for seven consecutive quarters, with growth of 4.94 percent in Q3 2023. This growth rate is accompanied by a controlled inflation rate at 2.56 percent year-on-year in October 2023 and improving social indicators. The latest Economic Outlook report from the IMF estimates that the Indonesian economy will grow by 5 percent in 2023 and 2024. ""Talking about the future means we will discuss two main things, namely those related to digitalization and decarbonization. We realize that currently the Fourth Industrial Revolution has disrupted many economic activities,” Airlangga said, adding that artificial intelligence (AI), robotization and ChatGPT are among factors that can disrupt the working world. He highlighted the Leaders Declaration in New Delhi, India on Sept. 9 to 10, where G20 leaders paid special attention to the responsible use of AI, while President Jokowi also said there was no need to be afraid of AI, as it continues to be developed even though there are no regulations yet. On the other hand, he said, it is necessary to anticipate a larger role for AI by preparing the competencies to become an AI engineer and expert as much as possible. In addition to digitalization changing the landscape of the global workforce, the world is also facing a climate change crisis, where every country must take joint responsibility for reducing carbon emissions. ""We need to continue collaborating to turn Indonesia into a global digital hub in Asia, and we want to do it in a low-carbon way. The digital economy in Southeast Asia is led by Indonesia, which is growing significantly. Indonesia and ASEAN are huge potential markets in developing the digital economy,"" Airlangga explained. The total population of ASEAN is more than 640 million people, with 480 million connected to the internet. In 2023, ASEAN's digital economic value is projected to reach a gross merchandise value (GMV) of $218 billion, with Indonesia being the largest contributor in ASEAN, which will reach around $130 billion in 2025. As the chair of ASEAN for 2023, Indonesia has also been able to strengthen the foundations of the ASEAN economy through several economic priority programs, one of which is accelerating negotiations on the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) as a strategy to accelerate digital economic transformation in the region. The growth of ASEAN's digital economic value is predicted to continue to increase to reach $2 trillion in 2030 with the implementation of the DEFA. ""We also believe that Indonesia can become a leader in providing environmentally friendly energy in the region,"" said Airlangga, noting that Indonesia is rich in important minerals such as nickel, copper, bauxite and silica, all of which are needed for battery materials. In addition, he outlined Indonesia’s significant clean energy potential in terms of hydroelectric, geothermal and solar power, with an estimated potential of 3,600 gigawatts. In this way, Indonesia will be able to become a place for the development of digital technology such as environmentally friendly data centers. In his closing remarks, Airlangga said Indonesia is currently in the accession process to join the OECD as an effort to accelerate the transformation toward a developed country. “Let's work together. The government cannot achieve this alone. We need the support and collaboration of all parties to face various challenges in the future. I hope that this forum can become a catalyst for world economic growth, and become a trigger that encourages you to develop your business and drive the Indonesian economy,"" he concluded";
Jakarta Post;Indonesian government initiates research to produce COVID-19 vaccine, VP says;T he government has initiated research to produce a vaccine for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), involving the collaboration of relevant ministries and institutions, Vice President Ma'ruf Amin has said. “We’ve started discussing [the research], because [the virus] has become a threat. We keep trying to develop our own vaccine for every threat that emerges. That’s why we’ve initiated research,” Ma’ruf said in a statement on Thursday as quoted by Antara. The research on the vaccine was carried out under the coordination of the National Research Agency (BRIN) in cooperation with the Health Ministry and other relevant state-owned enterprises, including pharmaceutical firms, he said. The public should not expect a vaccine to be available anytime soon, however, as the research would take a considerable amount of time to complete, Ma’ruf said. Read also: Doctors map body's COVID-19 immune response: Study In the meantime, the government would keep implementing public health protocols as established by the World Health Organization (WHO), he added. “The production of a vaccine takes time.

Meanwhile, Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java has prepared a research proposal for the production of a COVID-19 vaccine. Airlangga University rector Mohammad Nasih said the university’s Institute of Tropical Diseases had acquired six COVID-19-positive samples and was awaiting research authorization from the Health Ministry’s Health Research and Development Agency (Balitbangkes). “It’s going to be a lengthy process but we are optimistic that with Balitbangkes’ authorization we’ll be able to develop a vaccine,” Mohammad said.

Jakarta Post;Govt criticized for forming COVID-19 response team late in the game;T he government’s move to establish a new COVID-19 response team to handle the impact the pandemic has had on health and the economy has come too late, as the coronavirus has spread rapidly and paralyzed economic activity, experts have said. Airlangga University (Unair) public policy expert Agie Nugroho Soegiono said the government’s decision to only now establish an integrated team was a consequence of its previous lack of urgency in dealing with the virus when it first spread across the country earlier this year. “The government also lacked transparency and was indecisive in terms of health protocols,” he said on Tuesday. Although neighboring countries like Singapore and Thailand reported their first coronavirus cases in February, Indonesia denied suspicions that the virus had also spread into the country despite the millions of Chinese tourists who were coming in. Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) economist Latif Adam said on Tuesday that Indonesia was way behind other countries that had quickly reacted when the outbreak began. “Maybe the government is of the view that it is better late than never,” he told The Jakarta Post over the phone. The government launched on Monday a new team to tackle both the public health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic under the National Economic Recovery and COVID-19 Response Team. “With this integrated team, all the planning and execution of programs regarding the handling of COVID-19 and economic recovery could go hand in hand as both will be handled under the same institutions with good coordination,” Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto, who acts as the response team’s chairperson, said in a press briefing. Head of the economic recovery task force Budi Gunadi Sadikin and head of the COVID-19 response task force Doni Monardo joined the team to coordinate and integrate the country’s policies on handling the pandemic. They will report to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Minister Erick Thohir, the team’s executive chairperson. The response team comes as coronavirus infections continue to rise at a rapid rate nationwide. Indonesia recorded 1,906 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, putting the total number of infections at over 93,600 from only two in early March, according to official data. The death toll jumped to 4,576 with 117 new fatalities on Thursday. The pandemic has battered economic activity as shops, offices and factories are forced to close or limit operations to contain the virus. The Indonesian economy grew 2.97 percent in the first quarter from 5.02 percent in 2019 and is expected to shrink by over 5 percent in the second quarter due to the pandemic. The government has allocated Rp 695.2 trillion (US$47.55 billion) in state budget funds to strengthen the healthcare system and boost economic recovery. Latif said he expected the government to have better coordination now that there was a clear order of command. When the virus began spreading in the country, government officials had shown a lack of coordination in handling the pandemic. When the Jakarta administration was planning to suspend intercity and interprovincial buses services in late March to curb contagion, for instance, then-acting transportation minister Luhut Pandjaitan blocked the plan. In another case, the Industry Ministry issued its own coronavirus guidelines that allowed factories to open even though the Quarantine Law stipulated a suspension of workplace activities. A member of the House of Representatives Commission IX overseeing health care and manpower, Netty Prasetiyani, asked the government to create more robust health policy on handling the virus. The government, she said, had been favoring the economy over public health. “It’s not surprising at all. The budget for the country’s COVID-19 response is being [allocated] half-heartedly. As a result, hospitals are overwhelmed and health workers are dying,” she said on Tuesday. Read also: Don’t ‘misinterpret new normal’: Govt expects new team to meet health, economic goals Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) economist Enny Sri Hartati said on Monday that Indonesia needed better leadership, not just a new government team, as the main problem hindering the country’s COVID-19 response was poor coordination between government ministries and regional administrations. University of Indonesia rector Ari Kuncoro, however, expressed optimism that the team would be effective in handling the outbreak and the economic recovery as it would have more power, a greater budget and better planning compared to the previous COVID-19 task force. “This team is putting both health and economy as the top priority, not one over the other, because if the economic wheels are not running, we can’t fund the health efforts to handle this pandemic,” he said.;
Jakarta Post;Critics slam med school head dismissal, demand his reinstatement;INDONESIA SOCIETY Critics slam med school head dismissal, demand his reinstatement Constitutional law experts have slammed the recent dismissal of Budi Santoso from his post as medical school dean at Airlangga University in East Java, calling it to be a violation of the 1945 Constitution and evidence that academic freedom in the country is in tatters. Dio Suhenda (The Jakarta Post) PREMIUM Jakarta Mon, July 8, 2024 Young physicians hold posters during a demonstration on July 4, 2024, in front of Airlangga University's medical school in Surabaya, East Java. During the protest, which was also attended by professors and other academics on campus, they demanded that university rector Mohammad Nasih reinstate Budi Santoso as the dean of the school so he could complete his term. Budi was dismissed after disagreeing with the Health Ministry's plan to invite foreign doctors to practice in Indonesia. (Antara/Didik Suhartono) C onstitutional law experts have slammed the recent dismissal of Budi Santoso from his post as medical school dean at Airlangga University in East Java, calling it a violation of the 1945 Constitution and evidence that academic freedom in the country was in tatters. Budi was allegedly sacked by the university’s rector, Mohammad Nasih, earlier this month for publicly opposing the Health Ministry’s plan to bring in foreign doctors as a solution for medical staff shortages across the country. While both Airlangga University and the Health Ministry denied the accusation, critics have pointed to Budi’s removal as evidence of shrinking civic space and compromised academic freedom. The ministry claimed previously that it had no authority regarding the dismissal. In response to the event, a group of 25 constitutional law experts, including Brawijaya University law school dean Aan Eko Widiarto as well as notable academics Bivitri Susanti and Feri Amsari, said Budi’s dismissal violated Article 28 of the 1945 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression, and the 2012 University Law ensuring academic freedom.

Jakarta Post;RI steps closer to becoming vaccine hub If the trials are successful, the company seeks to obtain emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) by next month and start production right away.;"I ndonesia is edging closer to becoming a vaccine hub, as a number of locally developed COVID-19 vaccines enter the advanced stages of clinical trials and are expected to be mass-produced in the next few months. State-run pharmaceutical firm Bio Farma started on Thursday the phase III clinical trials of a locally made COVID-19 vaccine candidate called the State-owned Enterprises (BUMN) vaccine. It is in the last stage of clinical testing in humans, during which the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm and expand the results on its safety and efficacy from phase I and II trials. The development of the BUMN vaccine started in June of last year in cooperation with Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, the United States. The vaccine candidate, which uses a piece of the coronavirus spike protein called the receptor binding domain as its platform, was first tested on humans in December of last year. Bio Farma has recruited 4,050 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 70 for the phase III clinical trials. The trials are being conducted in four universities across the country: the University of Indonesia (UI) in West Java, Diponegoro University in Central Java, Andalas University in West Sumatra and Hasanuddin University in South Sulawesi. If the trials are successful, the company seeks to obtain emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) by next month and start production right away. Aside from the BUMN vaccine candidate, a research team from Airlangga University in East Java, in cooperation with local firm Biotis Pharmaceuticals Indonesia, has also recently finished the second round of clinical trials for another homegrown vaccine candidate called the Merah Putih vaccine. It is named after the color of Indonesia's red-and-white flag. Professor Ni Nyoman Tri Puspaningsih, coordinator for COVID-19 products research at Airlangga University, said the researchers were currently waiting for the green light from the BPOM to conduct the final clinical trials for the Merah Putih vaccine. Airlangga rector Mohammad Nasih told the press recently that he expected the phase III clinical trials for the vaccine candidate to begin this week, involving some 3,500 volunteers. Biotis is scheduled to produce the inactivated virus vaccine by July or August if the final stage of the clinical trials goes well. Indonesia's efforts to produce local COVID-19 vaccines started in the early days of the pandemic, as the country struggled to procure enough vaccine supplies to jab its 208 million targeted population. Seven research teams from various institutions – led by the Education, Culture Research and Technology Ministry – are involved in the project, with each working on different vaccine platforms, from inactivated virus to mRNA technology. Besides Airlangga University and Biofarma-Baylor College of Medicine, there are five other institutions that are creating homegrown vaccines, including UI in cooperation with privately held pharmaceutical company Etana Biotechnologies Indonesia that are developing DNA, mRNA and virus-like-particle vaccines and the Bandung Institute of Technology with a viral vector vaccine. Others are Gadjah Mada University, which is working on a protein recombinant vaccine, Padjajaran University in cooperation with Biofarma and Australia-based research company Lipotek on protein recombinant and mRNA vaccines, the National Research and Innovation Agency’s (BRIN) Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology that is working on a protein recombinant vaccine and BRIN's Biotech research team also working on a protein recombinant vaccine. BRIN's head of vaccine and drug research Masteria Yunovilsa Putra said that the Eijkman team was currently preparing for the pre-clinical trial for its protein recombinant vaccine but did not give further details on the progress of other teams. Important milestone BPOM head Penny K Lukito said the development of the BUMN vaccine was “a giant step for Indonesia in achieving drug and vaccine independence”. ""We hope that the vaccine can become a high-quality, safe, effective vaccine and be a competitive product [globally],"" Lukito said in a statement on Thursday. State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said that the pandemic had revealed the importance of vaccine and drug independence for Indonesia. ""We don't want to continue depending on other countries to fulfill our vaccine and drug demands. [...] The government will continue to support Bio Farma to upgrade its production facilities and to implement other vaccine technologies such as mRNA and viral vector,"" he said. Erick said that the company, at the moment, was set to produce some 120 million doses of the BUMN vaccine per year. ""However Bio Farma could ramp up its vaccine production up to 500 million doses per year. We will consider improving its manufacturing capacity if necessary, especially considering Indonesia is aiming to become a global vaccine hub,"" he said. Since the early days of the pandemic, President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo has been aiming to make Indonesia a global vaccine manufacturing hub, following difficulties in procuring COVID-19 vaccines for its huge population. Aside from Bio Farma, which could manufacture 500 million doses of vaccine per year, Biotis has said that it could produce some 240 million doses of vaccine a year, making Indonesia's capacity for producing homegrown coronavirus vaccines stand at around 740 million doses a year. Indonesia's capacity is still relatively minuscule compared with other vaccine hubs such as China, which can produce up to 7 billion COVID-19 vaccines per year, or India, which could manufacture some 3.3 billion doses of vaccine a year. Domestic vaccine needs Despite both BUMN and Merah Putih vaccines being initially designated for primary vaccination in adults, authorities have said that both vaccines would be mainly used as a booster shot and to vaccinate children, as at the moment Indonesia has fully vaccinated most of its population. As of Tuesday, Indonesia has administered 369 million primary doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to 62 percent of its population. The government is aiming to vaccinate 70 percent of the country's population by the end of the month. According to the BPOM, Indonesia needs some 44.8 million doses of vaccine to fully vaccinate its targeted population over the age of 12. The country is currently holding some 47 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from grants and imports. Meanwhile, Indonesia has only jabbed 23 percent of its 208 million targeted population with a half-dose booster and only 64 percent of the country's 26.4 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 have been fully vaccinated. This means it still needs some 80 million doses of vaccine for the third dose and 15 million doses of vaccine to fully inoculate children.";

Radhiyya Indra (The Jakarta Post) PREMIUM Jakarta Wed, July 10, 2024 Young physicians hold posters during a demonstration on July 4, 2024, in front of Airlangga University's school of medicine in Surabaya, East Java. During the protest, which was also attended by professors and other academics on campus, they demanded that the university rector reinstate Budi Santoso as the dean of the faculty to complete his term. Budi was dismissed after expressing opposition to the Health Ministry's plan to invite foreign doctors to practice in Indonesia. (Antara/Didik Suhartono) A irlangga University professor Budi Santoso has been reinstated as the medical school dean following a backlash against the East Java university for dismissing Budi earlier this month allegedly due to his criticism of the government. Budi made a biting comment to the media on June 27 that he was against the Health Ministry’s plan to invite foreign doctors to make up for Indonesia’s medical staff shortages, noting that local medical schools could produce graduates of the same quality as foreign talent. Shortly after, on July 1, Budi was reportedly summoned by the university’s rector and was dismissed from his position, raising speculation that the dismissal was because of his public criticism. The university’s move sparked outrage from the public and constitutional law experts, with the latter claiming that Budi’s removal violated his rights to freedom of expression and academic freedom as guaranteed in the 1945 Constitution and the 2012 University Law, respectively. Dozens of the university’s lecturers, staff members, students and alumni staged a protest against the dismissal last week. Some suggested that all lecturers, vice deans and staff remained on strike until Budi was reinstated as the medical school dean.

Prior to entering the test venue on Sunday, she had to undergo a body temperature check, wash her hands at least twice and clean her desk and computer with disinfectant wipes. As Indonesia scrambles to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, some 703,875 test-takers are trying to keep themselves together in order to earn a place in one of the country’s state universities, all while following strict health protocols that one expert has criticized as ""misguided"". Taking a computer-based exam (UTBK) is one of three ways high school graduates can earn one of the limited number of places offered at state universities in Indonesia, which has been trying to increase its university participation rate from the current 30.29 percent. The exams will be held in two batches, from July 5 to 14 and from July 20 to 29 at 74 test centers in cities across the country, including in the COVID-19 epicenters of Surabaya in East Java and Jakarta, with rooms at universities and schools being used as test venues. The Institution of University Entrance Exams (LTMPT), formed in 2019 to oversee the exams, requires body temperature checks on site and has advised test-takers to wear masks, face shields and gloves. It also reduced the number of participants in each room and the number of sessions to just two from four a day. But some local administrations and universities are now requiring test-takers to also undergo a rapid antibody test before sitting the entrance exam. LTMPT issued a circular on July 5, the first day of the exams, stating that those would had recorded “reactive” rapid test results – indicating virus exposure – or those with a temperature above 37.5  degrees Celsius would be required to take the more conclusive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on their own before proceeding with the entrance exam. If the PCR result comes back negative, they may reschedule their UTBK test to the second batch of exams, but if positive, they will not be allowed to take the test at all. Read also: Computer-based university entrance test to be held in two phases during pandemic LTMPT head Mohammad Nasih, who is also the rector of Airlangga University in Surabaya, said those with a fever or who tested positive for COVID-19 should ""focus on their health first"". Only once they recovery could they reschedule their exams ""if there is still time"". He pointed to the Surabaya administration and the University of Halu Oleo in Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, as examples of entities that had made “nonreactive” rapid test results or negative PCR tests results a requirement to sit the exam. Other universities, such as Soedirman University and Sebelas Maret University (UNS) in Central Java, another province hit hard by the outbreak, have instituted a similar requirement, but only for test-takers traveling from other regions. One high school graduate from Ngawi, East Java, could not take the UNS admission tests on Sunday after failing to present evidence of a rapid test result, rector Jamal Wiwoho said, as reported by tribunnews.com. Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city that accounts for half of East Java's COVID-19 cases and deaths, drew criticism for announcing the new requirement only three days before the first batch of exams started, prompting test-takers to swarm testing facilities in the city. A petition on change.org urging Surabaya to conduct free rapid tests for UTBK test-takers made the rounds on social media, citing that ""the prices for rapid and swab tests are very expensive"" and that ""the decision was issued so suddenly that test-takers scheduled for the UBTK's first batch were confused"". At least 9,927 people had signed the petition as of Tuesday. ""It is too sudden. I was hoping they'd provide free tests. I paid Rp 200,000 [US$13.9] for mine [rapid antibody test], which is already discounted from the normal price of Rp 400,000 for UTBK test-takers,” said 18-year-old test-taker Firmansyah Putra Pratama from Surabaya. “The prices vary, some places charge more than Rp 300,000."" The Surabaya administration said it would offer provide free rapid tests at community health centers for test-takers from low-income families, while some universities are providing the tests, with some test kits coming from the East Java administration. Indonesia, which has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, is currently prioritizing its free PCR tests for people with symptoms or who have been in contact with confirmed cases. But even now some have to wait a week or more for their test results as labs are not evenly distributed across the archipelago. Those seeking to undergo swabs tests on their own accord face prices that range into the millions of rupiah. Health Ministry director general for health services Bambang Wibowo told a hearing with lawmakers in June that PCR tests were indeed ""quite pricey"" and that government facilities might spend up to Rp 1.2 million per PCR test and that the prices charged by private facilities could be higher. The more commonly found rapid antibody tests are cheaper in comparison, and also give faster results, but experts have warned that such tests produce inconclusive results and, therefore, should not be used for diagnosis. Read also: Hundreds of thousands of rapid test kits imported from Netherlands made in China: Report Epidemiologist Windhu Purnomo from Airlangga University said the test requirement was ""confusing"" and demonstrated a ""misguided"" understanding of the function of rapid tests. He said the tests could be used for COVID-19 surveillance and mass screening, but not to terminate transmission chains, let alone for making decisions on whether test-takers could sit the exams. ""Rapid tests cannot be carried out just once,” he said. “It cannot be assumed that nonreactive results mean someone is free of the virus and cannot transmit the virus; they might have it but their antibodies have not yet formed. And those with reactive results may not actually have an active infection but still are required to go home, isolate and reschedule.”";

Jakarta Post;How political, economic interests fail our universities University officials are likely to build a close relationship with government officials, members of the political elite and people with strong social, cultural, political and economic resources to pursue their personal gains.;The exam is being conducted in two phases with a total of 42,463 participants. JP/Wendra Ajistyatama (JP/Wendra Ajistyatama) Like it or not, Indonesian universities have limited international recognition compared to other universities in the region. The University of Indonesia (UI) is the only one ranked under 1000 in the Times Higher Education and together with the other three state universities -- Gadjah Mada University, Airlangga University and Bandung Institute of Technology -- joins the top 500 of QS World University Ranking in 2022. At the national level, however, our universities have been plagued with bad news, scandals and controversies, related to both academic or non-academic policies and activities. Numerous cases of sexual violence on Indonesian campuses have been reported in the last few years with the majority resolved outside the judicial process. Corruption has been quite rampant in public and private universities across the country, most recently involving the rector of Lampung State University (Unila). The rector was caught in the act by the Corruption Eradication Commission of collecting bribe money during the student admission program. The rector set the price at between Rp 100 million (US$6.73) and Rp 350 million for each new student. According to Kompas report (July 28), the opportunity to study in universities has become limited to those who belong to the upper-middle-class groups thanks to the annual increases in tuition fees that go beyond the standard of living of most Indonesians. Universities have also stirred a controversy for their generosity in awarding honorary doctoral degrees and professorship to politicians or government officials without taking into account their extraordinary achievements. Education Ministerial Regulation No. 65/2016 and No. 38/2021 may justify such policies, but put academic independence and autonomy of the universities at risk, while internally they endanger the principles of fairness and meritocracy. ;
Jakarta Post;From test kits to robots, Indonesia develops locally made devices to aid COVID-19 battle The Research and Technology Ministry's consortium for COVID-19 studies has pushed for the development of domestically produced medical equipment to boost the country's battle against the pandemic. ;"A s demand for medical devices and innovation grows in virus-hit Indonesia, the Research and Technology Ministry's consortium for COVID-19 studies has pushed for the development of domestically produced medical equipment, ranging from test kits to robot assistants, to boost the country's battle against the pandemic.  The consortium, comprising research institutes, universities, private companies and state-owned enterprises, has developed rapid diagnostic test kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — amid shortages of reagents used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, Research and Technology Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said. Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada University (UGM), Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java, and medical equipment manufacturer PT Hepatika are set to produce 10,000 synthetic peptide-based Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M (IgG and IgM) antibodies rapid detection kits by Friday. Some 50,000 more test kits will be made by June after the equipment passes the validation test through public use. The Bogor Institute of Technology in West Java also aims to produce 10,000 gen spike and nucleocapsid rapid detection kits and codevelop 100 prototypes of biosensory-based rapid detection kits with Bandung-based Padjadjaran University by July. Bambang previously acknowledged that rapid testing kits would be less accurate than PCR tests considered by experts to be the “gold standard"" for coronavirus detection. However, he said the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) was currently in the process of developing more accurate test kits using the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Read also: Antibody tests key to ending COVID-19 lockdowns The LIPI-developed rapid testing kits are expected to be ready in July, Bambang said during a work meeting with the House of Representatives on Tuesday. ""The advantage of this rapid test is it is equally as sensitive to PCR tests and can produce results in about one hour, [faster than PCR],"" he said adding that the method did not use PCR reagents. Meanwhile, state-owned pharmaceutical company PT Bio Farma, genome firm Nusantics, Indonesian International Institute for Life Sciences (I3L), Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology and the Health Ministry's Research and Development Agency (Balitbangkes) are set to produce 50,000 PCR test kits by the end of May, with 10 boxes currently being validated and registered. The consortium also developed domestic-made Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and emergency ventilators involving 28 developers, including the University of Indonesia (UI), automotive holding Dharma group and the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT), to meet the Health Ministry’s demand. The ventilators are expected to enter the mass production on May 12.

Set to be launched on May 20, the laboratory will be able to conduct drive-thru testing and test up to 260 samples a day. Furthermore, a joint team from Surabaya-based November 10 Institute of Technology (ITS) and Airlangga University Hospital (RSUA) developed a robotic assistant for medical staff called RAISA, which is expected to also reduce physical interaction between healthcare workers and patients. RAISA, which stands for Robot medical Assistant ITS-Airlangga, could be utilized to remotely deliver food, clothes and medicine for patients in isolation, Bambang said. The consortium is currently conducting studies to look for raw materials that could be domestically sourced to produce personal protective equipment as well as to search for local herbs that could function as immune-boosting supplements. Additionally, the consortium will participate in global research efforts for finding a COVID-19 cure and vaccine, as well as develop plasma, serum and stem cell therapy.

(JP/Wahyoe Boediwardhana) A li Hayes has been working as a lecturer in political science at Murdoch University in Australia for the past six years. But despite his academic knowledge, he said he was nervous when facing various questions from local people in a recent program organized by the World University Association for Community Development (WUACD). The community development program, which followed a proposal by Surabaya-based Airlangga University, brought 20 foreign lecturers to visit East Java late last month to communicate directly with the local communities and help find solutions to improve their lives. “My heart is pounding. I have never done something like this before. This is a first time experience. I have never interacted directly with the people at the grassroots level. Especially in Indonesia, the culture of the people is different,” Hayes said after he talked with local people in Ngepung village in Probolinggo. In the dialogue, many women -- mostly mothers who are active in the integrated health post (Posyandu) in Ngeteh hamlet in Ngepung -- asked him about how to improve their lives. They also asked about how their children could become lecturers and how to work abroad -- some honest questions Hayes said he had no academic answer to. ""Give your children the opportunity to look for experiences outside the region. Not just around here. This is not specifically taught in college. I answer based on my family experience,"" Hayes said. Hayes was among the 20 foreign lecturers who visited various communities in the province, including high school students in Sidoarjo, people living in Probolinggo and at the foot of Mount Bromo, in a three-day WUACD program last month. The scholars came from 14 universities in nine different countries, including Australia. Another participant, Sherlyn Mae F. Hernandez, who is a lecturer in political science at De La Salle University in the Philippines, was also nervous about giving the right answers to the questions raised by the local people. And just like Hayes, she answered the questions based on her personal experience. R";

Jakarta Post;COVID-19 leaves lab workers grappling with unprecedented testing scale Hardly ever mentioned alongside other front-line health workers like doctors and nurses, laboratory workers in Indonesia are grappling with an unprecedented scale of testing for the highly contagious coronavirus, as piling samples overwhelm short-handed labs.;"Hardly ever mentioned alongside other front-line health workers like doctors and nurses, laboratory workers in Indonesia are grappling with an unprecedented scale of testing for the highly contagious coronavirus, as piling samples overwhelm short-handed labs. In a country where the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the golden standard testing method to detect the new virus, is deemed exclusive mainly for research rather than diagnostic purposes, a shortage of lab workers capable of running the tests has hindered mass testing efforts. Laboratory workers are on edge as the government looks into easing the already loose social restrictions despite new cases continuing to soar. They fear that future samples pouring in would be more than they can handle. Freelancer laboratorian Muhammad Mijar Al Faridzy in Surabaya, East Java’s capital and Indonesia’s second-largest city, which is now the COVID-19 epicenter, said his lab had recently been receiving almost twice the number of samples it did when he started the job in April. The private lab was looking to recruit more people as piling samples began to overwhelm him and his colleagues, who had to work longer hours lately, Mijar said. ""There are many laboratorians, but not all are trained to run the PCR machines, and that is the problem,” Mijar, who is also a veterinary intern, told The Jakarta Post. “Some of my fellow university friends only learned a bit about [PCR] in college, so they do not automatically understand how it works [upon graduating].” Read also: 50 days of Indonesia’s partial lockdown. Is it enough for the ‘new normal’? Mijar, who is tasked with the laborious process of manually extracting the virus' RNA from the samples, also shared his worry of contracting the virus even with his personal protective equipment (PPE) on, especially since he still lives with his parents in a densely populated part of Surabaya. His concerns are justified, as at least three workers at the biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory of Airlangga University's Institute of Tropical Diseases (ITD-Unair) in Surabaya have contracted the virus. The incident adds to the long list of frontliners comprising doctors and nurses who have been infected with the virus in Indonesia. Unair spokesperson Suko Widodo told the Post that it remained unclear how they contracted the virus but admitted that the lab had indeed been overwhelmed with the flood of samples. The lab has decided last week to stop accepting samples from hospitals other than the university's hospital, citing short-staffing as the reason as it tried to avoid a further backlog of tests. Earlier in May, COVID-19 task-force head Doni Monardo said the limited number of laboratory personnel hampered efforts to meet President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo's target of 10,000 tests per day. As a result, labs expected to run for 24 hours could only run for 8 hours, he said. He highlighted the need to train lab workers and said the government had sought assistance from the Indonesian Doctors Association (IDI) as well as from an association of midwives and from community health centers to provide human resources for the labs, while also mulling to give lab workers extra incentives. Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) Biotechnology Research Center head Puspita Lisdiyanti criticized the Health Ministry’s tardy decision in allowing more laboratories to process the tests in April, saying that labs needed much more time to prepare. The decision allowing various laboratories to conduct the tests as long as they meet certain criteria was issued a month after Indonesia confirmed its first COVID-19 cases in March and long after scientists called for the decentralization of testing. Testing on a scale never before seen in Indonesia required a large number of trained staffers familiar with molecular biology working in shifts to ensure they remain focused at work, hence minimizing accidents that could lead to them being infected, she said. ""Manual extraction is a tiresome process; with PPE and N96 masks, workers might have difficulties breathing after just two hours,” she said. “The solution is to add more human resources, more shifts and also automatic extraction machines [...] Otherwise they might grow tired and forget to follow protocol. Even just fixing their glasses due to sweating could expose them to the virus.” Read also: Indonesia targets local COVID-19 strain in Eijkman-led 2022 vaccine initiative LIPI has, since March, virtually trained 600 lab workers across the country and trained 10 non-LIPI staffers to be sent to other labs, and it is looking to train more this month. However, mobility restrictions and physical distancing made it difficult to train workers from other regions amid growing demand due to the uneven distribution of lab workers across Indonesia, Puspita said. A volunteer at a lab in Jakarta, Roswitha Muntiyarso, said the number of samples her lab received had declined, though not significantly, but she feared a new wave of infections would emerge once the so-called government’s new normal scheme was put in place. ""Especially when people's level of understanding of the virus is not the same [...] and their awareness of physical distancing might subside once the restrictions are loosened,"" said Roswitha, who has been staying at a hotel and avoiding meeting her parents often. Fauqa Arinil Aulia, an intern at a COVID-19 referral hospital's lab who had to join as a frontliner right after finishing her residency in clinical pathology in March, said the work had taken a toll on her physically and mentally, especially as she had to take extra caution while living with her parents and children. ""I am exhausted, that is for sure, but how can I stop; who else will do it?"" she said.";
Jakarta Post;Solution-driven research, robust ecosystem needed Strong, research-intensive higher education institutions provide the necessary fabric for the country’s “academic ecosystem” from which innovation will grow.;Students from Airlangga University’s School of Medicine examine sputum samples at the school’s microbiology laboratory in Surabaya, East Java. The government is seeking to boost research in higher education in a bid to improve the quality of Indonesia’s universities. (Antara/Moch Asim) P resident Joko “Jokowi” Widodo recently declared his plan to improve Indonesia’s competitiveness by refocusing the research and innovation agenda. This initiative needs to be supported. The key to focus on the right areas lies within two factors. First, we need to identify the strategic research to focus on. To do this, we must understand our competitive advantages that will allow us to contribute to solving global challenges. Second, we need to invest in high quality domestic researchers and research-intensive universities, as they are the basis of the country’s research and innovation architecture. The country needs to build a robust “academic ecosystem” centered around empowering its higher education institutions, from which scientific thinking can permeate the substrate of our ethos. Playing to our strengths is the solution-driven strategy. Increasing our national competitiveness lies within developing a problem-solving mindset and in our rapid moving era, this means solving global problems. To successfully transition from a resource-based to a knowledge-based economy, a national problem-solving mindset is necessary, thus research and innovation is the key. For Indonesia, this transition is imperative to break free from the middle-income trap. Consequently, the entire research and innovation agenda must be designed with a clear understanding of the underlying global challenges. As we begin this transition, we must recognize our competitive advantages to prioritize our research focus. For example, Indonesia’s biodiversity is rated second-highest in the world. With such resources at our fingertips, combined with traditional knowledge, we can pave the way to leading the world in discovering new types of food and drugs. Another global problem that is gaining huge momentum is the need for sustainable energy. Located in the Ring of Fire, Indonesia is frequently hit by natural disasters, however it also means we are in a prime position to utilize our geothermal energy resources (of which we possess over 40 percent of the world’s capacity) and become a prominent contributor to this global challenge. The prospect of being a new sustainable energy provider is not the only advantage of Indonesia’s unique geography, as with our need for disaster mitigation comes the potential to make this niche an area of expertise. Furthermore, Indonesia is home to more 700 languages with a myriad of cultures and ethnicities. Harnessing our knowledge, we should teach the world how to resolve and manage conflicts, a very valuable ability as more countries become increasingly multicultural. This diversity characterizes Indonesia and will therefore also allow us to become a beacon of cultural tourism. ;
Jakarta Post;Asian universities rise in global sustainability leadership rankings Amid global SDG funding gaps, Asian universities are stepping up as leaders in sustainable finance, driving research and innovation to shape a more sustainable future.;"A s global efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) face mounting financial shortfalls, universities across Asia are emerging as key players in sustainable finance. The Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings 2025 highlight a growing presence of Asian institutions in sustainability leadership, with 22 of the top 50 universities now coming from the region, an 83 percent increase from the previous year.  This shift comes at a critical moment. According to the UN Sustainable Development Report 2024, only 15 percent of SDG targets are on track, while more than 30 percent show stagnation or decline. The financing gap is particularly severe in emerging economies, where governments struggle to mobilize resources for climate action, education and infrastructure. Universities, traditionally seen as knowledge producers, are now being recognized for their role in sustainable finance, bridging research with policy and investment strategies.  Meeting SDG targets requires more than institutional commitment, it demands financing on a scale that traditional sources are unlikely to deliver. According to the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), the country faces a funding shortfall of US$1.7 trillion by 2030 to meet its SDG commitments. Similar gaps exist across Southeast Asia, where declining international aid and rising fiscal pressures have forced governments to seek alternative financing mechanisms.  Universities are increasingly stepping into this space. Academic research centers contribute to the design of financial taxonomies, ESG standards and impact measurement tools, helping governments and investors align funding with sustainability goals. Institutions are also engaging in green bonds, sustainability-linked loans and blended finance models, providing expertise in structuring financial instruments that attract both public and private capital.  The THE Impact Rankings assess universities based on their contributions to the UN SDGs, measuring research, teaching, stewardship and outreach. While traditional academic rankings have long been dominated by institutions in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, the Impact Rankings reveal a shifting landscape. Asian universities are increasingly setting benchmarks in sustainability and social impact, leveraging their expertise to influence policy and investment decisions.  In Indonesia, universities are collaborating with development banks, regulators and ministries to build capacity and provide evidence-based recommendations for sustainable finance. Research centers at institutions such as Airlangga University, University of Indonesia, the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) and Gadjah Mada University have contributed to policy frameworks on carbon pricing, renewable energy investment, climate finance governance and child protection through Islamic social finance. Viewpoint Every Thursday Whether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, ""Viewpoint"" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most. View More Newsletter By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Privacy Policy SIGN UP Beyond research, universities also facilitate training for government officials and financial professionals, ensuring that sustainability principles are integrated into national and corporate financial planning. Their role in convening public and private actors is critical, especially in a fragmented policy environment where coordination between stakeholders remains a challenge.  Recognizing the growing influence of higher education in sustainable finance, the UN has included an Academic Day in the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4). This marks the first formal participation of universities in global development financing discussions, where they will present research on financing strategies and enabling conditions for SDG investment.  The inclusion of universities in the FfD4 reflects a broader recognition that higher education institutions are not just passive recipients of funding but active contributors to financial innovation. Their ability to generate knowledge, test financial models and engage with policymakers positions them as critical actors in shaping the future of sustainable finance.  Sustainable finance is closely tied to education access, particularly in emerging economies. In Southeast Asia, gross tertiary enrollment rates vary widely. According to UNESCO, Malaysia exceeds 40 percent, Indonesia hovers around 36 percent and Cambodia falls below 20 percent.  Structural barriers persist, including declining international aid, rising tuition costs and limited digital infrastructure. Universities are not immune to these challenges, but they retain a level of independence and public credibility that allows them to advance inclusive policies. Many institutions are expanding need-based scholarships, integrating community engagement into curricula and promoting open-access research to extend knowledge beyond campus boundaries.  The growing presence of Asian universities in sustainability rankings is more than symbolic, it signals a shift toward embedding sustainable finance within academic and institutional priorities.  Visibility alone does not guarantee lasting impact. Long-term success depends on strategic alignment rather than short-term projects or publicity-driven initiatives. Universities cannot solve development challenges alone, but they offer a unique capacity: they generate knowledge, test financial models and share insights across sectors.  In a world of limited financial resources and increasingly politicized data, this contribution may become one of Asia’s most valuable assets in global development. ";
Jakarta Post;Muhammadiyah calls for crackdown on plagiarism, degree sales at universities;"M uhammadiyah chairman Haedar Nashir has urged President Prabowo Subianto to address problems of plagiarism and the sale of academic degrees at the nation’s universities. He said plagiarism and academic fraud in higher education reflected a troubling trend of unscrupulous opportunism in the pursuit of advancement. Recent plagiarism scandals, such as those involving the Economics and Business Faculty at Airlangga University, alumni of the University of Jember and the rector of Walisongo State Islamic University, have brought these issues to the forefront. Furthermore, a professorship scandal at Lambung Mangkurat University in Banjarmasin this year further deteriorated public faith in the country’s academic system. The case involved the professorship applications of 11 lecturers at the university’s Law Faculty. The investigation found that the lecturers might have submitted academic articles to predatory journals, which are publications that lack rigorous peer review systems and are often exploited for financial gain. The fallout from the scandal led to Lambung Mangkurat University's accreditation being downgraded and the lecturers’ professor status being revoked.

View More Newsletter By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Privacy Policy SIGN UP ""The world of higher education must be reconstructed,"" Haedar said on Sunday, the day of Prabowo’s inauguration, as quoted by tempo.co. Haedar said reconstructing higher education involved cleansing campuses of unethical practices that could harm the dignity of the education sector, including the sale of academic degrees. ""The conferring of academic degrees damaging the order of the academic world needs to be regulated to maintain the academic dignity of Indonesian higher education,"" said Haedar. A recent example involved a doctorate awarded to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia by the University of Indonesia. Bahlil received the degree in less than two years, rather than the typical four, raising concerns over its legitimacy. The university said Bahlil had taken a research-focused degree course that did not require him to attend classes and that this had allowed him to complete the doctoral program faster than was typical. Haedar urged the Prabwo administration to transform universities into strategic institutions that contributed to the nation's educational goals and ideals. He expressed hope that Prabowo would fulfill his duties faithfully, upholding the Constitution and serving the people with integrity.";
Jakarta Post;Epidemiologist Pandu Riono's Twitter account hacked The twitter account of Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist and vocal critic of the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, was hacked Wednesday.;T he Twitter account of Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia (UI), was hijacked on Wednesday evening by unidentified hackers who posted several tweets. The handle, @drpriono, posted a picture of Pandu and a woman at 9:59 p.m., with that caption read: “After [spending a] holiday with [my] young mistress.” Five minutes later, the account posted another picture showing Pandu with the same woman accompanied by the caption: “My romantic night with her who will be my mistress.” The tweets were deleted on Thursday morning. Pandu confirmed to tempo.co on Thursday that his Twitter account had been hacked. The motive behind the breach is still unclear. Read also: Jokowi administration spends Rp 90.4 billion on 'influencers': ICW Pandu is known for being a vocal critic of the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the hacking, he criticized the potential COVID-19 remedies developed by Airlangga University in cooperation with the Indonesian Army and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN). The university’s rector Muhammad Nasih touted the supposed remedies as the first COVID-19 cure in the world. He said three combinations of medications – lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin – had already undergone clinical trials. Pandu said the medications had not be registered for clinical trials under the World Health Organizations (WHO), which has cautioned against physicians and medical associations recommending or administering unproven treatments to COVID-19 patients. The UI epidemiologist added that the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) had the right to decline authorization for the use of the medications. “There should be clinical trials [to check] whether all processes have followed correct procedures,” Pandu said on Monday, as quoted by tempo.co. Read also: Government critic faces incitement charges after WhatsApp hacked The BPOM said on Wednesday that additional trials needed to be conducted as it had found several critical findings that affected the tests’ validity. He also slammed the university for not reporting the research findings to the BPOM, but rather handing over the process to the BIN and the Army. Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) chairwoman Asfinawati condemned the hacking and called on authorities to investigate the matter. “There should be an investigation into the case because it often happens to those who are critical against the government.” (trn);

Of course, the government and the Health Ministry will see how it is for the non-PBI participants"" he said in a hearing with House of Representatives Commission VII overseeing research and technology on Tuesday. Bambang, who also heads the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) and is the person-in-charge of the national team to accelerate the development of a possible COVID-19 vaccine, said that the government was currently calculating the total cost of the vaccine. The government has allocated Rp 280 billion (US$ 18.8 million) in 2021 for the development of the locally produced Merah Putih (Red and White) vaccine. Read also: Govt to set aside Rp 37 trillion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement However, Presidential Decree No. 18/2020 on the national team for the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccine development opens the possibility of other sources of funding for the program beyond the state budget.

Jakarta Post;Vaccine hub ambitions Whether we can actually become a coronavirus vaccine hub remains in question, as we have less production capacity than the world’s current main vaccine producers, such as China. But it would be a victory simply to produce enough COVID-19 vaccines to fulfill our domestic needs.;"I ndonesia has moved a step closer to its goal of becoming a vaccine production hub, as a series of locally developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates enter the advanced stages of clinical trials. This is a crucial move, considering the prolonged pandemic and the potential for future outbreaks. One of the vaccine candidates, called the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) Vaccine, was developed by state-run pharmaceutical firm Bio Farma in cooperation with Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, the United States. It is now in the last stages of clinical testing in humans. If the trials are successful, Bio Farma hopes to start production next month after obtaining approval for emergency use from the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM). Airlangga University has produced another homegrown coronavirus candidate vaccine. In tandem with local firm Biotis Pharmaceuticals Indonesia, the state university is waiting for the green light from the BPOM to hold the final clinical trials for the Merah Putih candidate vaccine, which uses an inactivated form of the virus. If the final stages of trials are successful, the developers say they expect to start production in July or August. The Airlangga-Biotis project is part of the Merah Putih vaccine development scheme led by the Education, Culture, Research and Technology Ministry. It involves a handful of universities and institutions, each working on different vaccine technologies, from inactivated viruses to mRNA techniques.

View More Newsletter By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Privacy Policy SIGN UP If Indonesia is able to produce its own coronavirus vaccines, we will no longer need to compete with other countries to secure necessary vaccine supplies, and we could even help other countries in need. While no one can really predict when the pandemic will end, the future might depend on how we wield our virus-fighting arsenal – vaccines in particular. This has become more pressing of late as the country prepares for a possible new wave of cases. It recently reported the first four know local transmissions of the highly contagious BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which have fueled surges of infections overseas. Indonesia has seen an uptick in COVID-19 infections over the past few weeks after the government relaxed pandemic restrictions further, and the booster dose administration rate remains at a low 23 percent of the targeted population. Whether we can actually become a coronavirus vaccine hub remains in question, as we have less production capacity than the world’s current main vaccine producers, such as China. But it would be a victory simply to produce enough COVID-19 vaccines to fulfill our domestic needs. Before the pandemic hit, Indonesia actually was named a “center of excellence” in vaccine supply and production by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in late 2017. With the OIC's recognition, Indonesia is expected to assist the Muslim world in the production of various vaccines and other pharmaceutical products, as well as to advance research on the production of halal vaccines. It is possible that people may need periodic booster shots to fight COVID-19 at some point, if or when the coronavirus becomes endemic. But whatever the future holds, Indonesia must step up its game in COVID-19 vaccine production for the sake of the nation's continuing safety";

Jakarta Post;Quran teacher in Makassar accused of molesting students The abuse came to light after one of the victims’ mothers became suspicious of why her daughter suddenly refused to go to class.;A 55-year-old male Quran teacher in Makassar, South Sulawesi, has been reported for allegedly sexually abusing his students. Makassar Integrated Care Center for the Empowerment of Women and Children (P2TP2A) head Andi Tenri Pallalo said the office had received a total of five reports against the teacher, identified only as MP, from victims’ families so far. “We have been handling this case since last week. We are currently assisting and conducting assessment by psychologists because the victims are minors,” Tenri said on Saturday. She said the victims were girls aged 9 to 12 years old. The abuse came to light after one of the victims’ mothers became suspicious of why her daughter suddenly refused to go to class. “After being questioned, the girl said that she was molested by her teacher,” Tenri said. After the mother reported the alleged sexual abuse, other victims’ families came forward with similar allegations. Tenri said there might be other victims that had yet to file reports. The Makassar City Police’s Women and Children Protection (PPA) unit head Insp. Ismail said the police had received reports from three victims as of Saturday. He said that according to the victims’ testimony, MP had sexually abused them during their Quran recitation lessons. “The victims would be approached by the Quran teacher and then he would put his hands under their clothes and touch their private parts.” Ismail added, however, that MP had yet to be summoned for questioning, because police were still collecting evidence to strengthen the case. In a separate case, the police in Surabaya, East Java, have detained a former student of Airlangga University (Unair) alleged to have sexually assaulted multiple victims after tricking them into helping him to do academic “research”. The suspect, identified only as Gilang, was apprehended on Thursday in Kapuas, Central Kalimantan, with the cooperation of local police personnel, the head of Surabaya City Police’s mobile detective unit, First. Insp. Aris Risky, said. “[Gilang] was transported to Surabaya this morning after undergoing a COVID-19 rapid test in Kapuas Regional General Hospital,” Aris said as quoted by kompas.com on Friday. At least three people have reported Gilang to the police. Officers have questioned them and several other witnesses and raided his rooming house to collect some of his belongings as evidence, Aris said. Gilang is currently in the custody of the Surabaya City Police to be questioned intensively over the allegations, he added. The case gained nationwide attention recently after several victims took to Twitter to share their accounts of being tricked by Gilang into performing an act known as “bondage mummification” under the pretense of academic research. One user with the handle @m_fikris wrote that he and his friend agreed to participate in Gilang’s thesis “research” about “wrapping” in July after Gilang persistently begged him, saying he was at risk of failing his studies for not finishing his thesis. Gilang was in his fifth year of university. Gilang sent instructions for @m_fikris and his friend to take turns covering each other’s bodies, including their mouths and eyes, with duct tape. He also instructed them to wrap their bodies in jarik (traditional Javanese cloth) and later asked them to record the process and to send him the footage afterward. On Wednesday, Unair announced that it had officially expelled Gilang from the university’s School of Cultural Studies as its investigation had found that he had committed sexual assaults on the victims;
Jakarta Post;Surabaya mayor provides insurance law experts Praying for loved ones: Members of Mawar Sharon Church attend a prayer service held for relatives of AirAsia flight QZ8501 victims in Surabaya;Surabaya Mayor Tri Rismaharini has offered experts on insurance law from Surabaya Airlangga University, East Java, to help the families of the victims on AirAsia flight QZ8501, which crashed into the Karimata Strait. '€œI don'€™t understand law in the insurance world. That'€™s why I asked insurance law experts from Airlangga University to assist the victims'€™ families,'€ Risma, as the mayor is affectionately called, told The Jakarta Post, Sunday. Risma said that the experts would assist the victims'€™ families by examining the calculated insurance values and reading the insurance contract thoroughly so they would not become victims again. '€œI want AirAsia to pay to the victims'€™ families thoroughly,'€ she said. She added that assistance would be available for non-Surabayans as well and that she was ready to help communicate with heads of the regions where the respective victims originally came from. Risma said that all the data concerning the victims who originally came from Surabaya had been collected 12 hours after the aircraft lost contact with Jakarta air traffic control and was sent to banks and insurance offices. Ronny Tanubun who represented passenger Adrian Fernando, 13, of Surabaya welcomed the mayor'€™s move, saying that it was the right step to take as most of the families of the flight accident victims did not understand insurance. '€œI conveyed my misgivings to Bu Risma after receiving the calculated insurance payments from AirAsia several days ago,'€ Ronny said. The aircraft plunged into the Java Sea along with its 155 passengers and 7 crew on Dec. 28. Most of the passengers were Surabaya residents. AirAsia President Director Sunu Widyatmoko did not respond to the question regarding the insurance payments during a press briefing conducted at the East Java police'€™s crisis center. Previously, AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said that his company would take full responsibility for all the victims and crew members of the ill-fated flight and would provide compensation for the families of the victims. Separately, chairman of the East Java branch of the Consumer Protection Institute Foundation (YLPK), Said Sutomo, said his office was preparing to sue AirAsia if investigations revealed that the company violated flight license and passenger safety procedures. '€œThe government should withdraw all AirAsia aircraft operating in Indonesia so that their safety measures can be audited,'€ said Said. Meanwhile, Associated Press reported that around 100 family members of AirAsia Flight 8501 crash victims sought strength Sunday, one week after the disaster, while bad weather again prevented searchers from reaching a large object on the ocean floor that is believed to be the fuselage. Emotionally exhausted relatives sang and cried at a tiny chapel in Surabaya, the city where the plane departed from last Sunday with 162 crew members and passengers. The Rev. Philip Mantofa, who heads the congregation at the city'€™s Mawar Sharon Church '€” where more than a quarter of the crash victims were members '€” urged those gathered to find comfort in their faith while embracing the reality that no one survived the disaster. '€œIf God has called your child, allow me to say this: Your child is not to be pitied,'€ Mantofa told one Indonesian man seated in the front row. '€œYour child is already in God'€™s arms. One day, your family will be reunited in heaven;
Jakarta Post;Govt seeks help from universities, research agencies in running COVID-19 tests The ministry's disease control and prevention director general, Achmad Yurianto, confirmed the plan, saying it would be implemented on Monday.;"T he Health Ministry is allowing universities and research agencies to run lab tests for COVID-19, as instructed by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. The President said during a press conference in Jakarta on Friday afternoon that the ministry could cooperate with, among others, Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java and the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Jakarta in conducting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. As of Friday, the government had allowed only one lab run by the ministry’s Health Research and Development Agency to test swab samples of suspected COVID-19 patients. “I have told the health minister that other labs can run tests,” President Jokowi said.

Jakarta Post;In mRNA we trust The mRNA vaccines developed to fight COVID were found to be safe and effective, even for pregnant women, inspiring scientists to explore their potential.;"S cientists believe that mRNA vaccine technology, made famous as the technology behind some COVID-19 vaccines, could be a major breakthrough against several other diseases. A rapid response technology with many advantages, mRNA is considered relatively safe, and can induce strong immunity. Vaccines made with mRNA are also adaptive, cost-effective, and quick to make.  Scientists have worked with mRNA since 1987, when Robert Malone tried to combine mRNA with fat droplets, enabling human cells soaked in the mixture to produce protein. However, it took a long time for scientists to believe that the mRNA produced was stable enough, effective in inducing an immune response, and safe. Just as mRNA technology proved its potential, a new coronavirus hit.  Vaccine development itself generally takes several years, with the previous record minimum four years for the mumps vaccine. However, the devastating coronavirus pandemic worldwide forced scientists to work at the speed of light. On 2 December 2020, less than a year after the world was first alerted to COVID-19, a vaccine developed by Pfizer in collaboration with BioNTech, a German biotech firm, became the first fully-authorised mRNA vaccine. The vaccines use a molecule called messenger RNA - a cousin of the more familiar DNA - to trigger the human body to produce a protein which is specific for the disease in question.  Our immune system then recognises and remembers the protein as foreign, allowing it to generate a strong immune response if the disease and its specific protein is encountered again.  When the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination began, the government of Indonesia and several other Asian countries chose to play it safe and recommended pregnant women didn’t get the jab. It was only after several trials showed promising results that the Indonesian Obstetrics and Gynaecology Association finally gave a recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women with supervision in July 2021. COVID-19 significantly increases death or illness of both mother and baby as well as the risk of complications during pregnancy and birth. A review of published research by Airlangga University, with a total of 48,039 pregnant women, showed that mRNA vaccines provide greater benefits for pregnant women than harm. The mRNA-based vaccines reduced the risk of infection with COVID and did not cause any apparent harm during pregnancy. Further studies are needed to monitor the side-effects of the COVID-19 vaccine over the long term, especially in babies born to pregnant women who were given the mRNA vaccine.

View More Newsletter By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Privacy Policy SIGN UP In the future, mRNA vaccine technology also has the potential to be developed for other infectious diseases, such as influenza, dengue, zika, and chikungunya fever. Scientists simply need to modify a mRNA component of a vaccine instead of the entire thing for new diseases or strains. This makes developing new vaccines and adapting existing ones easier and faster.  With such promise, several vaccine developers are also exploring mRNA vaccines for traditionally difficult diseases such as malaria and HIV. Moreover, mRNA technology has not only been developed for infectious disease, but is also being explored for non-infectious diseases such as cancer. Over twenty mRNA-based immunotherapies have been tested in clinical trials so far, with encouraging results in solid tumour treatments. 2021 saw the launch of a global mRNA technology transfer centre. The idea is to support developing economies to increase their technical know-how on vaccine development and production. It is hoped that in the near future mRNA vaccines will be widely produced not only in developed economies but also developing economies, combating many diseases and helping to fulfill the sustainable development goals worldwide. --- The writer is a Lecturer and researcher at the Department of Physiology and Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Airlangga and Institute of Tropical Disease, Universitas Airlangga.

Jakarta Post;Who really needs weapons? We are at war and the soldiers on the frontline are doctors and nurses.;R ecently Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto announced his intention to buy 15 second-hand Typhoon jet fighters from Austria. Prabowo stated that these planes, which each costs US$124 million, are needed to fully equip the Indonesian Military. But who are we fighting now? As many countries strengthened themselves with the latest weapons technology in past wars, we too must equip our doctors and nurses with the best weapons we have to win this war on COVID-19.  By now we know that this is not a short battle, but a long war and our frontline heroes fight every day. They are tireless but tired. Dozens of the valiant fighters have lost their lives due to infection. Increasing the availability of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and programs in hospitals throughout Indonesia has the potential to protect these healthcare heroes. We often hear news reports that many patients are not completely honest about their symptoms and, in many instances, healthcare workers become exposed to the virus as a result. The latest research from the Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service Team suggests that because healthcare workers have a greater risk of being exposed to the virus repeatedly, their infectious dose or viral load is often higher. There is also evidence that a higher viral load leads to more serious illness. The high death rate of doctors and nurses in Indonesia and globally show how they are most at risk of becoming infected. Indonesia has a 6.5 percent death rate of healthcare workers, according to head of management at the Hasanuddin University Hospital, Irwandy. Our death rate is the highest in Asia.  This awful statistic demonstrates that we are at war and the soldiers on the frontline are doctors and nurses. We as a country have a responsibility to help and protect them. We should provide the most advanced AI technology and programs to reduce healthcare workers’ exposure and increase the care provided to patients. So, arm our healthcare workers with AI. Homemade AI medical technology has been applied on a small scale in Indonesia in this war on COVID-19. At the Airlangga University Hospital in Surabaya, East Java, for instance, RAISA robots deliver food to highly infectious patients to reduce interactions and the risk of transmission. RAISA was developed collaboratively by researchers at Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (ITS) and the hospital. In order to reduce the risks of healthcare workers throughout the nation, we must scale-up these technologies. AI should be our national defense priority.  It will be expensive, but so are Prabowo’s fighter jets. And, healthcare workers’ lives are undeniably more precious.  AI technology has joined the frontline of many countries’ fight against this virus. In China, robots provided patients with face masks and hand sanitizer upon arrival at clinics whereas in Britain robots have been used in routine sanitation of wards.  Alibaba has also developed an AI application that compares brain and lung scans of patients. This cloud-based program is now being used in Ecuador and the Philippines and has a diagnosis accuracy rate of over 90 percent. In Australia, a major trauma hospital in Melbourne is trialing an AI program to monitor patients at home. The program divides patients into three categories of severity. Ambulances are immediately dispatched for “red patients” whose condition is rapidly deteriorating. Nurses visit “amber patients” whose condition is worsening. Whereas the program monitors the vital signs of “green” patients whose illness is less severe.   In Brisbane, Queensland, the major hospital has implemented telepresence robots in its COVID-19 ward to facilitate doctor-patient communication and safely connect patients with their families and friends through video calls. Using this technology can make patients less anxious, which according to University College London and King’s College researchers is crucial for their body to fight the virus.  There have also been many tragic stories in Indonesia and around the world of patients dying alone and families unable to say goodbye. AI can bring them together. In many religions, followers want to seek guidance while they are sick, and especially if their condition worsens. With telepresence technology, imams, priests and other trusted religious leaders can carry out pastoral care. We have a responsibility to care for those who care for us – to protect doctors and nurses. AI is an important tool in our armory to fight COVID-19 and to offer safe and holistic care to patients. Every day we read of new record case numbers and that this virus has taken the lives of our fellow citizens. For every 100 deaths, six are healthcare workers. We are losing those who we need most at this critical moment.  The Indonesian government should focus on the war we are currently in. Although researching and implementing AI in hospitals throughout Indonesia will be expensive, this technology can give hope and much needed support to our doctors and nurses.  While Prabowo emphasizes the need for weapons to protect our country, our healthcare worker heroes are on the battlefield. Other countries are building stronger shields to safeguard their doctors and nurses. Indonesia has a choice to recruit AI to support our hospitals or to persist with the current strategy and resources;
Jakarta Post;Airlangga highlights importance of GWS to protect Java’s northern coastline;I ncluding national growth in the last third quarter of 2023, spatially, Indonesia’s regions have experienced positive growth and have showcased resilience. Java was one of the biggest contributors to national gross domestic product (GDP) with a 57.12 percent share. The figure highlighted Java as one of the major economic engines in the country. With its competitive edge, Java faces a number of challenges, such as the threat of erosion threat, abrasion, floods and land subsidence along Java’s northern Pantura coastline. Along the northern coastline, land is decreasing between 1 and 25 centimeters per annum, and sea surfaces rising between 1 and 15 cm per year in several locations. “A study by JICA  [Japan International Cooperation Agency] has found that growth in the Pantura area accounted for 20 percent of Indonesia’s GDP with industry, fishery, transportation and tourism activities. Pantura is home to 50 million people and this population of 50 million will be potentially affected [by land loss]. So, this will not only endanger the economic and infrastructure sustainability but also the survival of the community,” said Coordinating Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto when delivering the opening speech at the National Seminar: Strategy for Java Island’s Protection Through the Construction of Giant Sea Wall (GWS) in Jakarta on Jan. 10. The number of looming threats for Java’s northern coast will affect the sustainability of economic activities and increase the disaster potential for millions of people residing in the area. The degradation-related threats, if left unhandled, are predicted to threaten the existence of 70 industrial parks, five special economic zones (SEZs), 28 Industry-Designated Estates, five Industry Growth Center Areas and various national logistic infrastructure sites, such as airports, railway lines and seaports. “With this seminar, it is hoped that the program can kick off so we can expand the scale and make this program transformative in nature,” Airlangga said. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto said in his keynote address that the construction of the GWS could be an answer to the rising sea surface and soil loss, and, at the same time, could be a solution for the poor quality of life that some Indonesians still faced. Prabowo expressed his gratitude for the ongoing study on the construction of the GWS and said the Defense University was tasked to conduct further studies on various aspects that related to the overarching idea of the construction of the GWS. “I want this [GWS] to be the topic of discussion, the topic of discussion in academic circles, for business people, technocrats and Indonesia’s engineers, and I ask them to conduct in-dept studies on the issue,” Defense Minister Prabowo said. Prabowo also shared his appreciation for Coordinating Economic Minister along with his ranks and those involved in organizing the national seminar. Attending the seminar were House of Representatives members, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Home Minister Tito Karnavian, Agrarian Reform and Spatial Planning Minister Hadi Tjahjanto, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono, Defense University Rector Lt. Gen. Jonni Mahroza, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) researcher Dwi Sarah,  Witteveen Bos Indonesia Victor Coenen, Coordinating Economic Ministry Assistant Raden Pardede, Coordinating Economic Ministry secretary Susiwijono Moegiarso, Coordinating Economic Ministry speaker Haryo Limanseto, acting Banten governor Al Muktabar and a number of the government officials from echelon 1 and 2 as well as regional heads from along Java’s northern coast.;
Jakarta Post;Lecturer blames '€˜lack of knowledge'€™ for rising fanatism, misguided beliefs A show of extremism: A black flag associated with the Islamic State (IS) group is displayed in a press conference last year;"Poor knowledge about the history of Islam has led the public to adopt fanaticism and misguided beliefs, which then helps to maintain decades-long economic disparities in the country. A sociology lecturer from the University of Airlangga in Surabaya, East Java,  Airlangga Pribadi, said Islam was actually conceptualized from the idea of sanctity and social justice. Therefore, the terminology of so-called ""progressive Islam"" could not be placed on a par with ""liberal Islam"", in which the latter recognizes the idea of capitalism and justifies the oppression of the public, he went on. Airlangga said progressive Islam must be seen as a method of social critique. '€œIndonesia in the post-Soeharto era has brought into an oligarchic capitalism that has carried us into neo-liberal capitalism,'€ Airlangga said. The sociologist was speaking in a discussion on the sidelines of the Belok Kiri (Turn Left) Festival at the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute Foundation (YLBHI) office in Central Jakarta on Saturday. '€œMany companies, which dominate our social and political spheres, emerged during that era,'€ Airlangga said. '€œAt the same time, fanatical Muslims have been nurtured and used to support the dominant power of oligarch groups,'€ he went on. Citing examples, Airlangga said regional leaders had often exploited hard-line Islamic groups to support and legitimate their authority. The Belok Kiri Festival is a major collective project developed by and for younger activists who strive for greater freedom of speech. Prepared a year ago, the event is being hosted by 40 volunteers aged between 18 and 40 from major cities across Indonesia.";
Jakarta Post;Doctors know no borders The ministry argued the foreign doctors may help solve the shortage of health professionals facing Indonesian hospitals.;"O ver the past two weeks, we have heard the bad news of the sudden dismissal of a medical school dean in Surabaya, East Java. From Medan, good news has circulated about a number of children recovering after successful heart surgery at the Adam Malik General Hospital in the North Sumatra capital. The two events seem unrelated at first glance but they revolve around the same issue: the government’s plan to invite foreign doctors to open practices in the country. The dean was shown the door allegedly for his opposition to the plan in public. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has been showcasing the successful surgeries in Medan, performed by a team of doctors from Saudi Arabia on a humanitarian mission, as a success story of foreign doctors helping and sharing knowledge with Indonesian physicians. The government is pondering opening the country to doctors from around the world as a move to solve some of the biggest medical issues in Indonesia, such as the shortage of doctors. According to Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data from 2023, the country only had 183,000 doctors, including specialists and general practitioners, serving 270 million people, making Indonesia one of the countries with the lowest doctor-population ratio. The World Health Organization’s has recommended that Indonesia increase the number of doctors to 270,000 to meet the threshold. The invitation for foreign doctors to plug in the gap is stipulated in the omnibus Health Law, which was passed by the House of Representatives last year. The Health Ministry followed up the implementation of the law by issuing a circular last month announcing the need for foreign doctors in government-run hospitals. Viewpoint Every Thursday Whether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, ""Viewpoint"" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most. View More Newsletter By registering, you agree with The Jakarta Post's Privacy Policy SIGN UP The ministry argued the foreign doctors could help solve the shortage of health professionals facing Indonesian hospitals. They could also share knowledge on how to improve medical services as evident in Medan. The health industry needs not only quality doctors but also improved services. There have been complaints from patients about the commercial mentality of our medical workers, leading them to  eventually seek medical treatment overseas. To appease concerns about foreign doctors taking the jobs of local doctors, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said the government would limit the international medical professionals’ work permit to four years. But what bothers us about the controversy over foreign doctors is how the government responded to dissenting views. Airlangga University’s School of Medicine dean, Budi Santoso, criticized the government’s plan, saying 92 medical schools across the country were able to produce graduates whose quality could match that of foreign doctors. Not long after, he was fired. The Health Ministry denied any link to the dismissal. But any appointment or dismissal of officials in state universities, including deans, must involve the government. Such abuse of power, despite any good intentions, should have no place in a democracy, which values academic freedom. Budi has been reinstated as the dean, but the incident will discourage other scholars from questioning the government’s policies. For one, the shortage of doctors has to be addressed to fulfill citizens’ right to health care and this is where foreign doctors can help. However, we need to acknowledge that foreign doctors are not the panacea. Among the pressing issues facing the country’s health sector is medical workers’ job security and welfare. After enduring a long and expensive medical education, doctors tend to avoid practicing in remote or underdeveloped areas in order to receive better pay checks in the cities, depriving people there of their right to medical care. It is important for the government to solve this distribution gap of doctors immediately. There have been insufficient incentives for doctors, as well as their families, to serve in outlying and disadvantaged regions. At its core, the medical profession is a humanitarian job, which is to help whoever in need. Doctors, therefore, know no borders, as the sick can be in urban or rural, rich or poor regions. It is the government’s responsibility to make sure doctors are available to all";
Jakarta Post;More universities throw their weight behind calls for fair election;Members of Padjadjaran University's Student Executive Council (BEM) deliver a speech at the university's campus in Bandung, West Java on Feb. 3, 2024. The university's professors, students and alumni urged President Joko “Jokowi“ Widodo, state officials, presidential candidates and other members of the political elite to ensure a democratic and ethical 2024 election. (Antara/Raisan Al Farisi) More universities throughout the country have lent their voices to calls for a fair and accountable general election, as concerns over state partisanship and democratic backsliding continued to gain traction in the week before voting day. On Tuesday, lecturers and students from Malang-based Brawijaya University in East Java made a public declaration calling for fair presidential and legislative elections on Feb. 14. Among their demands, as read out by lecturer Sukir Maryanto, were for the central government, regional administrations and the entire state apparatus to remain neutral, for the poll organizers and watchdogs to maintain their integrity, as well as for election contenders to campaign without using state resources. “[We] are urging the government and law enforcement authorities to uphold the principles of justice and fairness and [to refrain from taking actions that could] undermine democracy and freedom of speech,” Sukir said in a press release. Brawijaya University is only the latest university to publicly demand a fair, accountable election. On Monday, several universities across Java, including Airlangga University and Surabaya State University in East Java’s provincial capital of Surabaya, as well as the Indonesian University of Education (UPI) in Bandung, West Java, also made similar pleas. They were joined by several universities in Sumatra, including the University of North Sumatra and Malikussaleh University in Aceh, along with the academic senate of the University of Riau (Unri). ;
Jakarta Post;‘Jamu gendong’ in spotlight amid virus outbreak;Jamu (traditional herbal drink)  is enjoying a surge in popularity after Airlangga University molecular biologist Chairul Anwar Nidom suggested that drinking it could boost immune systems. Handayani is a jamu seller in Jakarta catering to customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Handayani filled up bottles with jamu she had made several hours earlier. She put the bottles in a bamboo basket and carried it on her back using a cloth sling. She was ready to sell the herbal medicine from door to door, known as jamu gendong. Handayani, who has been a jamu gendong seller for 20 years, sells a variety of jamu, such as kunyit asam (turmeric, ginger and tamarind), jamu paitan (bitter medicinal herb), temulawak (curcuma), beras kencur (rice and galangal) and air jahe (ginger drink). Every morning and late afternoon, the 50-year-old Handayani offers her jamu across residential areas in Petukangan subdistrict, Pesanggrahan, South Jakarta. Her loyal customers affectionately call her budhe, a Javanese word to address middle-aged women. Handayani was born and raised in Karanganyar, Central Java. She taught herself to make various kinds of jamu, some of which are scientifically proven to have health benefits;
Jakarta Post;Shiite children in desperate need of psychological counseling Children affected by Sunday’s riot in Sampang, Madura, East Java, are in desperate need of psychological counseling to help ease their trauma of witnessing the violence that led to the death of two Shiites and injured several others;C hildren affected by Sunday’s riot in Sampang, Madura, East Java, are in desperate need of psychological counseling to help ease their trauma of witnessing the violence that led to the death of two Shiites and injured several others. This was apparent in the writings and drawings of 64 children and 31 toddlers, who expressed their own fears of being attacked, having their homes burned and having to flee into the forest. Zulfa, one of the children, wrote that she was scared of being beaten by someone, having her house razed to the ground and being attacked with sharp weapons. Zulfa and other child victims are currently being sheltered in indoor tennis courts at the Sampang sports center together with adult evacuees. A number of volunteers from the Sampang Child Committee are staying with them, trying not to let the children become lost in their thoughts. “I need assistance from volunteers who are trained counselors,” the committee’s coordinator, Untung Rifai, told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. He said he was overwhelmed with trying to handle dozens of children and help them with their psychological wounds. He expressed his hope that counselors from Surabaya’s Airlangga University (Unair) Crisis Center would come to Sampang to lend a hand. “They already have the experience of accompanying riot victims in Sampit, West Kalimantan,” he said. Some of the children, according to Untung, had also expressed their wish to stay in their own homes, return to school and live peacefully in Sampang. The committee responded by providing a games schedule while the children studied on the floor of the sports center. The committee has just received help from a volunteer teacher from Sampang’s north coast. However, there has not been any response yet from the local education office regarding the need of such volunteers. “We need as much help from volunteer teachers as we can get. The children also need counseling,” said Untung. Adult evacuees, numbering 277, also need counseling. Many of them have an empty look in their eyes and are subdued as they are not engaged in any activity, while the female evacuees still lack a number of things, such as diapers, formula and powdered milk, and other women’s necessities. According to the volunteer coordinator at Ahlulbait Indonesia (ABI), Muadz Muhammad, his group was still making an effort to collect these items from donors. The government, via the Social Affairs Ministry, has dispatched 25 volunteers, but it also needs to send counselors to deal with the widespread trauma. There is only one counselor at the shelter. “I’m in dire need of counselors. The Unair Crisis Center should have responded, given their experience in Sampit,” said Muadz, adding that at least five counselors and dozens of volunteers were still needed to deal with the situation in Sampang. Based on the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) data, around 60 people are unaccounted for. They are believed to still be in hiding in nearby forests, or staying with residents and relatives near Sampang. “We are still looking for them. They should be encouraged by Shia clerics to come out and join the others,” said Fatkhul Khoir, a worker with Kontras’ East Java branch. Members of the House of Representatives’ Commission III overseeing human rights are scheduled to inspect the scene of the incident and the temporary shelter on Thursday. As of Wednesday, East Java Police had questioned 12 Shia followers from Karang Gayam subdistrict who were victims of the Sampang attack. Previously, the police had questioned eight people regarding Sunday’s violence, bringing the total of those questioned to 20. Of them one, identified as Roisul Hukama, has been named a suspect, according to Antara news agency. He is the Sunni brother of incarcerated Shia leader Tajul Muluk, and is alleged to have been behind the attack on the Muslim minority group;
Jakarta Post;Civil groups condemn cyberattacks on Indonesian government critics Digital attacks have been made in the past week on a scientist and two websites known to be critical of the government's COVID-19 response.;C ivil groups have condemned recent cyberattacks on the websites of two prominent institutions and the social media account of a scientist, all of whom have been critical of the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling them a threat to democracy and freedom of speech. The Twitter account of Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia (UI), was reportedly hacked on Wednesday. The handle, @drpriono, posted pictures that aimed to damage Pandu’s reputation. The account was secured on Sunday and the pictures deleted. Prior to the incident, Pandu slammed a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by Surabaya-based Airlangga University, saying it had yet to undergo clinical trials. He also criticized the university for not reporting its findings to the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) and handing it over to the State Intelligence Agency (BIN) and the Indonesian Army instead. Pandu has been voicing his concerns about the government’s COVID-19-related policies, such as tourism promotion amid the pandemic, campaigns for a “new normal” and the ineffectiveness of rapid antibody tests that have become a requirement for traveling. On Thursday midnight, news website tempo.co, which is a part of Tempo Media Group that also publishes Koran Tempo daily and Tempo weekly magazine, was hacked until early Friday. The media group’s pandemic reported has included criticism against government policies.   At 12:30 a.m., the homepage turned black and played “Gugur Bunga” (Fallen Flowers), a patriotic song honoring fallen wartime heroes, for 15 minutes. The screen displayed the message, “Stop Hoaxes, Don’t lie to the Indonesian People, Return to true journalistic ethics [and] obey the Press Council. Don’t [bow down to] people who pay. Deface By @xdigeeembok.” Tempo.co chief editor Setri Yasra said the attack was an attempt to silence the media.  “We condemn anyone who tries to interfere with the work of the press. Press products are not always perfect, but we have a controlled mechanism, we have a press council to go to,” Setri told The Jakarta Post on Friday. The website of a research group that is also known to be critical of the government’s coronavirus policies, the Center for Indonesia’s Strategic Development Initiatives (CISDI), was hacked for three days starting on Wednesday. The attack caused the institution to lose important documents on its website, cisdi.org. The Civil Society Coalition, whose members include Amnesty International Indonesia, the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute (YLBHI) and the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet), demanded that the government and law enforcement bodies transparently investigate the cyberattacks and punished the perpetrators. Amnesty International Indonesia has recorded at least 35 cases of alleged intimidation and digital attacks on government critics since February last year. Read also: RI faces heightened threat of cyberattacks amid outbreak “The government must explain and share their information to the public — whether the attacks against the critics have anything to do with the government — because the public doesn’t have the tools or access [for an investigation],” YLBHI chairwoman Asfinawati told The Jakarta Post on Saturday. Amnesty International Indonesia executive director Usman Hamid said if the hackers were found to be part of the state, there should be no impunity. “Silencing criticism is a violation of human rights. The people’s rights to express their opinion is guaranteed in both Indonesia’s Constitution and international human rights laws,” Usman said in a written statement on Friday. Communications and Information Minister Johnny G Plate said labeling the cyberattacks as “silencing criticism” was a serious, groundless accusation. “Don’t make accusations based on assumptions. Cybercrime happens every minute on any digital platform, including digital businesses and government websites, not just tempo.co or Pandu Riono’s account,” he told the Post on Saturday. Read also: Indonesian businesses ramp up cybersecurity budget amid rampant attacks Johnny said the ministry was ready to help but expected the victims to be proactive in reporting their case to the ministry or to the police, so the latter could move quickly to track down the perpetrators. In addition, the ministry and the National Cyber and Encryption Agency (BSSN) could audit the security system of the hacked parties. “The ministry cannot take action if there is no report. For example, we can’t just go into Tempo’s system without permission, right?” He added that the ministry would like to evaluate and improve Tempo’s cybersecurity system. “A strong system won’t be easily breached. The rising number of cyberattacks is a reminder for us to improve our security system and protect our digital space.”;
Jakarta Post;PCR tests remain gold standard, but many factors affect results;"W hile recent reports have called the reliability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests into question, experts agree that they remain the best tests for COVID-19 but acknowledge that various factors affect results. Recently, the State Intelligence Agency (BIN), whose significant involvement in the country's pandemic response has raised questions and criticism from civil society organizations, rejected a report by Tempo magazine that its PCR tests were inaccurate. The BIN, which has received Rp 5.57 trillion of the COVID-19 response budget, said false positives and negatives were found in other countries as well and that several factors affected test results among different labs. ""There are some factors that can affect differences in swab test [results]. They include the machine’s condition, the time of the test, the patient’s condition and testing kit quality,"" the agency's spokesperson Wawan Hari Purwanto said in a statement. Read also: No PCR tests: What you need to know about new discharge criteria Experts told The Jakarta Post it would only be fair to compare test results if samples were taken at the same time and were sent to different labs that had the same PCR settings. Indonesia operates some 263 labs for COVID-19 testing, and they have a variety of machines and testing kits. But even before samples reach labs, certain variations can affect results, including when and how samples are taken, transported and stored. ""PCR tests show the best results within the first three days of the onset of symptoms – if patients show any symptoms at all – because that's when the viral load is believed to be at the highest level,"" said Maria Lucia Inge Lusida, a professor of clinical microbiology at Airlangga University (Unair). ""The longer the period between symptom onset and the administration of the test, the lesser the viral load becomes and the higher the chances are for negative results,"" added Inge, who leads the university's Institute of Tropical Diseases. The PCR testing process also requires well-trained personnel, and the scarcity of such medical professionals has been cited as a reason for Indonesia's low testing rate. Aryati, a clinical pathology professor from Unair who chairs the Indonesian Association of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Specialists (PDS PatKLIn), said the testing work required great attention to detail, from taking the samples properly to pipetting materials and processing the tests. ""Without caution, there could be contamination,"" she said. The machine settings and the reagents used can also affect test results. Different machines target different sets of genes that belong to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and some genes degrade more quickly than others, causing variations in detectability over time, Aryati said. She added that some genes were found in other strains of the virus as well. The BIN and experts have highlighted the cycle threshold, or CT value. PCR tests amplify samples’ genetic matter in cycles to bring indicators of the virus to a detectable threshold. A lower CT value means fewer cycles were required to identify the virus, suggesting a higher viral load. PCR machines in Indonesia set varying limits on the cycles, ranging between 31 and 45, but many in the country are set at a cutoff of 40 cycles, according to experts. If the virus is not identified within the specified number of cycles, the test result is negative. If the virus is found within the cycle limit, the result is positive. ""The BIN has set the limit higher than other institutions, as seen through the CT value of its real-time PCR. The lower threshold is 35, but to avoid misdetection of asymptomatic cases, the BIN has increased the limit to 40,"" Wawan of the BIN said. Aryati, however, said results from different PCR settings, including CT cutoffs, could not be compared so easily. She said that if the CT value was set at 31 in a device with a maximum of 31.5, then if the same sample were tested using a device with a maximum of 40 or 45, the CT value should be around 39 or 44 respectively, a similar proximity to the maximum threshold. A low CT value, which could indicate a high viral load, is associated with a person being more infectious and vice versa. Some studies of viral cultures have found that CT values higher than 34 or 35 were much less likely to be cultured, meaning they were no longer likely to be infectious. Read also: Use antigen tests for screening but with caution Noting that the complexity of PCR tests could affect public trust in test results, experts have urged people to leave the interpretation to medical professionals and have emphasized that PCR tests remain the gold standard in detecting the virus despite the possibilities of false negatives and positives. Inge said that while they were not perfect, PCR tests were the best means of detecting the virus for now.

Jakarta Post;Indonesia is edging closer to becoming a global vaccine hub Indonesia is edging closer to becoming a vaccine hub, as a number of locally developed COVID-19 vaccines enter advanced stages of clinical trials and are expected to be mass-produced in the next few months.;A woman (left) reacts while receiving a Pfizer booster vaccine for COVID-19 in Jakarta, on March 29. The government accelerated its vaccination programs ahead of Idul Fitri in May when many were expected to leave the capital to return to their hometowns. (AFP/Adek Berry) I ndonesia is edging closer to becoming a vaccine hub, as a number of locally developed COVID-19 vaccines enter the advanced stages of clinical trials and are expected to be mass-produced in the next few months. State-run pharmaceutical firm Bio Farma started on Thursday the phase III clinical trials of a locally made COVID-19 vaccine candidate called the State-owned Enterprises (BUMN) vaccine. It is in the last stage of clinical testing in humans, during which the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm and expand the results on its safety and efficacy from phase I and II trials. The development of the BUMN vaccine started in June of last year in cooperation with Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, the United States. The vaccine candidate, which uses a piece of the coronavirus spike protein called the receptor binding domain as its platform, was first tested on humans in December of last year. Bio Farma has recruited 4,050 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 70 for the phase III clinical trials. The trials are being conducted in four universities across the country: the University of Indonesia (UI) in West Java, Diponegoro University in Central Java, Andalas University in West Sumatra and Hasanuddin University in South Sulawesi. If the trials are successful, the company seeks to obtain emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) by next month and start production right away.

Jakarta Post;Risk communication key as virus deaths surpass 30,000 After becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to reach the 1-million mark of COVID-19 cases, Indonesia has recorded nearly 30,000 deaths because of the coronavirus disease.;"T he lack of proper risk communication by the relevant authorities has been blamed for the worsening COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, which recently saw its case number pass 1 million, with 30,000 deaths, including over 600 health workers. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said the 1-million-case mark should become a moment for the nation to mourn. “There’s deep grief among us as we pass this mark but this is also a reminder that we still need to work hard, so our late friends’ sacrifices won’t have been in vain,” the minister said during a press briefing on Jan. 26. However, epidemiologists have said that grief is not enough and urged the government to communicate the COVID-19 risks better to the general public to ease the burden created by the disease. Epidemiologist Dicky Budiman from Griffith University, Australia, said the public’s perception of the coronavirus disease had been poor from the beginning due to information conveyed by the government that undermined the real magnitude of the outbreak. For example, the government keeps lauding the number of people recovering from COVID-19, which continues to rise over time. Meanwhile, the number of active cases and positivity rate are often underreported. Read also: How two officials testing positive depicts the state of Indonesia's COVID-19 response On Monday, the Health Ministry confirmed 10,994 new cases, bringing the tally to 1.08 million. With a total of 883,682 recoveries and 30,277 deaths, Indonesia currently has 175,349 active cases. Monday's positivity rate – the ratio of positive cases discovered for every test conducted – was 34.47 percent, as only 48,213 tests were recorded in the official tally. “Data is neutral, but the positive and negative sides must also be conveyed. The government can’t just deliver good news. That’s how it has been and this is very wrong in risk communication,” Dicky said recently. The national COVID-19 task force also came under fire on social media on Friday for holding a talk show on the tourism recovery strategy amid the pandemic. Twitter users have replied to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s (BNPB) tweet on the talk show recording, saying that the government should prioritize public health instead of tourism. The general public and experts previously slammed the government for relaxing the latest public activity restrictions (PPKM) policy, with data showing that the relaxations on such restrictions had led to more COVID-19 cases and health protocol violations. First imposed on Jan. 11, the restrictions for 77 regencies in Java and Bali were extended until Feb. 8, but with less stringent restrictions than before. For example, authorities now allow shopping malls and restaurants to operate until 8 p.m., while they were only allowed to open until 7 p.m. during the previous period of the PPKM. Coordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto said the government decided to relax the restrictions as it found that the COVID-19 transmission rate had “somewhat flattened” in the two weeks of the first period of the PPKM. President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo expressed his concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions during a meeting with state officials on Friday, saying that PPKM were ""not effective"". This statement, however, stands in stark contrast to his earlier assertions that the government had the situation under control, which were made not long after the imposition of PPKM. Read also: ‘Wrong’ strategy brings Indonesia closer to 1 million COVID-19 cases Dicky said the mistaken communication strategy had created denial among the general public, resulting in families refusing to hold funerals under the CVID-19 protocols and declining to take the vaccination. While the ministry had made several signs of progress in communicating risk and being open with data under the new minister, the epidemiologist said the overall measures to contain the pandemic depended on President Jokowi. “With the pandemic getting out of control over time, the government’s poor performance will eventually affect the public’s faith in them,” Dicky said. Experts also urged the government to improve its testing and tracing capabilities to contain the pandemic rather than merely depending on the vaccination program. Since the second week of January, Indonesia has regularly confirmed over 10,000 cases daily, but its testing capacity has remained low. According to data compiled by worldometers.info, Indonesia is one of two among the 20-worst hit countries with fewer than 100,000 tests per million of population alongside Mexico with only around 30,000 tests. Windhu Purnomo, an epidemiologist from Airlangga University’s School of Public Health, said the government must focus on increasing the rate of cumulative testing from only 2.5 percent to 15 percent of the population. The government must prioritize testing all suspected cases especially those showing symptoms while increasing contact tracing to achieve the recommended ratio of 25 contacts traced per case, he added. Epidemiologists said these efforts should be the government’s current priority instead of vaccination as the country is competing with more than 200 countries in securing the limited vaccine supply thus reducing the chance of boosting the ongoing vaccine rollout. As of Monday, health authorities had inoculated around 530,000 health workers in a nationwide vaccination program that kicked off on Jan. 13. The government’s vaccination drive, which began earlier this month, aims to inoculate some 1.5 million medical workers from January to February. Between March and April, it is seeking to vaccinate 17 million public workers and 25 million elderly citizens. The program for the public at large is expected to start in April or May. Read also: COVID-19 treatment strains patients’ health, finances President Jokowi previously said he had instructed his administration to inoculate around 181 million people across the country by the end of this year – a plan deemed too ambitious by experts. A report recently published by the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that the COVID-19 vaccination drive in middle-income countries would likely stretch into late 2022 or early 2023, while the same program could go on until 2024 in poorer countries. Vaccine production and distribution are blamed as the main hurdles for these countries";
Jakarta Post;Fight for your freedom: Indonesian online civic space under siege Cyberspace is the latest arena in the endless battle over freedoms between state and civil forces, and Indonesia's digital democracy warriors aren't ceding a byte without a fight.;W hen Joko “Jokowi” Widodo left Surakarta, Central Java, to run for the governor of Jakarta in 2012, the future president was an icon of what Austrian sociologist Christian Fuchs calls “grassroots digital democracy”. With his army of cyber volunteers, Jokowi won the hearts of a budding online community desperate for drastic changes in Jakarta. The Jokowi Ahok Social Media Volunteers (JASMEV) is one of Jokowi’s largest groups of online volunteers. It took part in his campaigns, though not always officially, for the 2012 Jakarta election and the last two presidential elections. Jokowi’s political ascent spurred hope for a wider online civic space and the emergence of a digitally empowered civil society that could liberate the nation from the grips of the political elite. This hope could not have been more misplaced. Shrinking online civic space Indonesia’s online civic space has, in fact, been shrinking since Jokowi won the presidency in 2014. Digital rights and freedom watchdog SAFEnet has said that more and more people have been charged under the 2008 Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law under the President’s watch, peaking in 2019 with 3,100 cases. The figure is expected to increase this year, now that the National Police is patrolling the internet to nab those accused of spreading “hoaxes” and “hate speech” about the coronavirus. The police are currently investigating two high-profile ITE cases related to the pandemic. One involves a local punk drummer who peddled a COVID-19 conspiracy theory on his social media accounts, while the other involves a singer-songwriter turned YouTuber who interviewed a fraudulent professor claiming to have produced a cure for the disease. The situation has gone from bad to worse in recent months, with dozens of activists, journalists and academics critical of the government reportedly falling victim to various cyberattacks. The latest wave targeted an epidemiologist, an NGO and two media outlets – Tempo and Tirto.id  – that have been critical of the way the government has been handling the health crisis. University of Indonesia epidemiologist Pandu Riono cast doubt on the efficacy of the COVID-19 “cure” developed by Airlangga University scientists in cooperation with the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN), until unidentified hackers took over his Twitter account. The hackers then posted his private photos in an attempt to discredit the scientist. The Tempo website was hacked and defaced after it headlined the cyberattack on Pandu.  Meanwhile, Tirto.id said that two of its articles on production irregularities in the Airlangga-TNI-BIN coronavirus remedy “mysteriously” disappeared. The media outlet then re-uploaded the articles, only for the same thing to happen again. There is no evidence that the state was behind these cyberattacks. But this does not necessarily mean that the government is not culpable. At least 42 cyberattacks and digital intimidation targeting government critics have been recorded between February and August this year, according to Amnesty International Indonesia, with credential theft the most common form of attack. To date, police have solved none of these cases. Government is the usual suspect of cyberattacks in other parts of the world. Amnesty International has expressed concerns in the past decade that governments and armed forces are spying on journalists, NGOs and human rights workers. The first digital attack on a “civilian” target by allegedly state-sponsored hackers occurred in 2010 when Google announced that “a highly sophisticated and targeted attack” on its infrastructure was aimed at “accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists”. Hacking attacks targeting government critics has become more commonplace since, according to Amnesty. The 'Jokowi effect': e-participation or e-domination?  There is no doubt that social media has played an important role in raising Jokowi to take center stage in Indonesian politics. There are no grounds, however, to believe that he would be the first in line to defend digital freedom in the country. On the contrary, he could become the first to compromise it, considering the historical context of his political ascent. Here’s why. A doctoral research by Muninggar Sri Saraswati at Australia’s Murdoch University has found that the 2012 Jakarta election and the 2014 general elections – both of which Jokowi won – marked the rise of the digital election campaign industry in Indonesia. The new industry has in turn created an ecosystem that allowed the emergence of political influencers, widely and derisively known as “political buzzers”. While it is true that Jokowi has genuine volunteers among his online campaign groups, some “volunteers” of his digital army are, in fact, professionals who are paid to manage his online campaigns. Saraswati argues further that these elections’ social media campaigns were not “autonomous from heavy industry-driven engineering”, and that the growing online political campaign industry has allowed the political elite to “capture social media to safeguard their social ascendancy through competitive elections”. Indonesia’s cyberspace has since become a highly competitive public arena for the variety of social, political and economic forces in the country. This is why the social media campaign industry is still buzzing even after the elections, with the government reportedly spending around Rp 90 billion (US$6 million) on social media influencers since 2017. Such an antagonistic cyber climate is problematic for Jokowi and his allies, who now control state power and have access to the nation’s information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. The “Jokowi effect” could thus be seen as not just an example of what Fuchs calls “e-participation”, referring to technology enabling political participation by empowering the grassroots but also “e-domination”, in which state actors engage in information warfare or electronic surveillance to dominate or exclude certain groups from online civic space and networks. Technology does not develop in a vacuum to change how society and the state behave. In reality, as per Fuchs, society also designs technology and its effects are determined by a dialectical loop between the two. In the case of Indonesia, a shrinking online civic space is the current outcome of that endless loop. Prospects for grassroots digital democracy Indonesian civil society has long been a sphere of various contesting social and political forces. The state and the oligarchic powers behind it have never taken a back seat in this intrasocietal competition. They can and have formed alliances with incivic forces to weaken civic forces in order to protect their own political and economic interests. The creation of paramilitary group Pam-Swakarsa in the early days of Reformasi is often cited as an example of a state-sponsored uncivil organization. Sadly, the same pattern has been occurring in cyberspace. The use of “political buzzers” to muddy public discourse on salient social, political and economic issues – the latest example being the government allegedly paying influencers to promote the much-maligned omnibus law on job creation using the #IndonesiaButuhKerja (Indonesia needs jobs) hashtag – shows that this alliance has been extended to the digital realm. And this is occurring concurrently with the misuse of the ITE law and the cyberattacks on government critics. It is worth noting that while technology may be “designed” by society, it can also constrain as well as enable human action – meaning that the impacts of technology cannot be predetermined and therefore, the possibility still remains for the emergence of grassroots digital democracy that could counter any attempts by the state to control online civic space. Indonesia has already seen examples of how e-participation, which naturally fights for the interests of the many, can actually force policymakers to behave or not behave in certain ways. One recent example is #ReformasiDikorupsi (reform corrupted), an online campaign to protest the deliberations of controversial bills. The country’s online civic space may indeed be shrinking under Jokowi administration, but Indonesian civil society can use the very same technology to push back and reclaim it;
Jakarta Post;Dangerous levels of toxic chemicals found in blood of Indonesia’s waste workers An analysis conducted at WIOEH’s Green Hospital Laboratory in South Korea detected 23 hazardous plastic-related chemicals in all samples, with the waste workers showing significantly higher concentrations than the control group.; Waste pickers sift through a pile of garbage on May 20 at the Cilowong dump site in Serang, Banten. Despite playing an important role in the circular economy, waste pickers are mostly ignored and unprotected. (Antara/Asep Fathulrahman) A new study has found that Indonesia’s waste pickers and waste sorters, the often-overlooked backbone of the country’s recycling sector, carry dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals in their bodies because of chronic exposure to microplastics. The study was conducted by the Wonjin Institute for Occupational Environmental Health (WIOEH) in collaboration with environmental watchdog Ecological Observation and Wetlands Conservation (Ecoton) and the Faculty of Medicine at Airlangga University from August to November. Researchers collected blood and urine samples from 27 female waste pickers and waste sorters in East Java’s Gresik regency, along with samples from five local women who served as a control group.  Analysis conducted at WIOEH’s Green Hospital Laboratory in South Korea detected 23 hazardous plastic-related chemicals in all samples, with the waste workers showing significantly higher concentrations than the control group. Blood tests revealed alarming levels of phthalates (DEHP), which were twice as high as those found in the control group, while PAH (1-OH-pyrene) was 2.8 times higher. Flame retardants, including DPHP and DBuP, were present at two to three times the levels seen in control samples. The workers’ blood also contained BPA at 2.3 times the concentration of the control group, 10 times higher than levels reported in Korean women and seven times higher than in American women. ;
Jakarta Post;The rise of political digital attacks Cyberattacks on government critics have at least doubled in October compared with the previous six months. ;T he massive demonstrations against the Job Creation Law were also felt in the digital world. The protests from civil society against the omnibus law, manifested in the hashtags #TolakOmnibusLaw (reject the omnibus law) and #TolakUUCiptaKerja (reject the Job Creation Law), have become a trending topic in global cyberspace. At the same time, however, digital attacks on protesting activists and students have been on the rise. Based on monitoring by the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet), at least 16 cases of digital attacks targeting activists, workers and students have occurred as of Oct. 20 in the form of hacked Instagram accounts, takeovers of WhatsApp numbers, attempts to log in to Twitter accounts, hacked or defaced websites as well as doxing and other threats through WhatsApp and Instagram. Cyber attackers have targeted labor activist Mirah Sumirat, the president of the Indonesian Workers Union (ASPEK). She lost control of her phone number and WhatsApp the day before the big stunts on Oct. 8. She announced the incident through her Twitter account. Other attacks happened to students using the same method: Takeovers of WhatsApp numbers. Cyberattacks on government critics have at least doubled in October compared with the previous six months. SAFEnet observed 49 attacks from April until September 2020. That means, 8 attacks occurred per month on average. The most common form of attack was hacking (76 percent), followed by impersonation (5 percent), doxing (5 percent), attempts to log in (5 percent) and others. The attackers targeted almost all popular platforms, namely WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. The upward trend of digital attacks shows that day-by-day information technology is increasingly intertwined with political matters. Information technology on the one hand is a tool to encourage social political change, mainly by civil society, but on the other hand it has become a medium to repress activism by alleged state-sponsored actors. This can be seen from several indicators. First, the timing of the attacks is always closely related to political issues. Digital attacks tend to increase when there are controversial political debates, especially at the national level. Other than the controversy over the Job Creation Law this October, cyberattacks also increased in June as well as in August and September. In June we detected 11 digital attacks, as against 9 in August and 10 in September. What were the hot issues in those months? In June, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in the Unites States was intensifying in response to police violence against Afro-American citizen George Floyd. This racial discrimination created solidarity both online and offline in various parts of the world, including Indonesia. Nationally, the death of Floyd gave rise to a campaign against racial discrimination in Papua, expressed through the hashtag #PapuanLivesMatter. The second indicator is the cyberattacks aimed at those who challenged state actors. In August and September, digital attacks returned with the controversy regarding the reported discovery of a COVID-19 cure by Airlangga University, the Army and the State Intelligence Agency (BIN). The findings, which were considered substandard according to medical and scientific principles, were criticized by several epidemiologists, public health activists and the media. The critics, instead, have fallen prey to digital attacks. According to observation up until October, most victims were activists and journalists critical of the government. A total of 23 activists, 14 journalists and 9 students experienced digital attacks in the April-October period allegedly because of their criticisms. Activists in Papua experienced the most diverse attacks, from phone hacks and internet blackouts to doxing. Most of the attacks were related to their concern about discrimination of Papuans. Meanwhile, online media that experienced such attacks include Tempo.co, Tirto.id and Kompas.com. The attacks took the form of a defaced homepages and removed articles. The three online media were targeted by digital attackers following their reports on the controversial discovery of the supposed COVID-19 cure by the Army, BIN and Airlangga University in August. Another attack victim related to the issue of COVID-19 handling is University of Indonesia epidemiologist Pandu Riono, who has often criticized the government through his Twitter account. His Twitter account has been attacked and remains inaccessible until now, forcing Pandu to create a new account. A similar attack happened to the Twitter account of Ainun Nadjib, the initiator of the KawalCOVID19 movement, although it was unsuccessful, as he had implemented several mitigation efforts on his social media account. The third indicator is the silence of the state when cyberattacks are rampant. To exacerbate the state’s inaction, the deliberation of the data protection bill has been delayed. The House of Representatives reportedly will only conclude the debate of the much-awaited bill in November. The list of cyberattack victims may grow longer because, until today, controversy remains related to the issues of Papua, the government’s COVID-19 response and the Job Creation Law. More individuals, media and civil society groups are vulnerable to such attacks due to their defense of the rights of minority and marginalized groups like lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and queer (LGBTQ) people and indigenous people. The struggle of such high-risk groups through information technology will face tougher challenges due to the more sophisticated and massive reprisals by actors who have the ability and power to carry out cyberattacks. Therefore, it is now time for the high-risk groups and other human rights defenders to make digital security an important part of their advocacy. Capacity building, including with regard to awareness and skills in digital security, has become an urgent matter. They badly need information technology as an advocacy tool, but they also have to protect themselves from cyberattacks;
Jakarta Post;Businesses must have adequate support to prevent layoffs: Experts Workers in manufacturing and other labor-intensive sectors have been among those hit hardest by the COVID-19 outbreak. The government’s stay-at-home order has effectively halted production in nonessential industries.;"A s COVID-19 arrests most industry activity and disrupts global supply chains, millions of Indonesian laborers face a greater risk of being furloughed or losing their jobs entirely. The government must now ensure that businesses have adequate support to prevent layoffs, and – where job reductions are inevitable – the government must ensure that workers’ rights are protected, labor experts have said. “The options [for laborers] are quite limited. If they are dismissed, it is important that they secure full compensation as stipulated by the Labor Law. If they are furloughed, they should get full wages and THR [holiday bonus],” said Hadi Subhan, a labor expert from Airlangga University. “During the pandemic, what the government can do – and what furloughed or recently unemployed people need – is cash assistance. If this could be done by the government, that would be of great help,” he said. As the pandemic has hit employers and laborers alike, the government should issue a regulation that ensures the two sides meet if the companies reduce their workforce, University of Indonesia (UI) labor law professor Aloysius Uwiyono suggested. “There should be a legal basis as a reference for the employers and workers so they are on the same page. Without it, I think it will be difficult for them to discuss severance payment,” he said. About 375,165 formal workers have been laid off nationwide and 1.03 million formal workers have been furloughed during the COVID-19 crisis, while 314,833 informal workers have lost their livelihoods, according to data from the Manpower Ministry. The government predicts that 2.9 million to 5.2 million workers could lose their jobs during the outbreak. If that becomes the case, the additional unemployment would erase last year’s gains of 2.5 million new jobs. Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data shows that 7.05 million people – 5.28 percent of the workforce of 133.56 million – were unemployed as of August 2019. Data from the Office of the Coordinating Economic Minister shows that 15,747 factories remain in operation in regions where large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) have been applied – about a third of the approximately 40,000 manufacturers that operate under normal circumstances. The companies are currently employing about 4.7 million workers out of the 17 million people who usually work in the sector. Workers in manufacturing and other labor-intensive sectors have been among those hit hardest by the COVID-19 outbreak. The government’s stay-at-home order has effectively halted production in nonessential industries.  “The work-from-home approach is applicable only to workers in certain workplaces, but those in manufacturing cannot do it because they do everything in the factories,” said Aloysius. Read also: On May Day, workers marches go online to avoid coronavirus risk The Indonesian Labor Workers Assembly (MPBI), a coalition of three major labor groups, has demanded employment protections amid the pandemic, noting that airlines, hotels, travel agents, restaurants, logistics firms, online transportation services, digital economic firms, as well as micro, small and medium enterprises have seen the most layoffs. They estimated that layoffs in these sectors could account for 90 percent of the total number of people who lose their jobs during the outbreak. Said Iqbal, president of the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions (KSPI), which is a member of the MPBI, demanded the government require public audits on companies that claimed financial losses, as he believed not all sectors had been hit equally by the pandemic. “We want public audits for companies that claim losses. For those that survive, we demand they pay full THR and wages so that these workers can maintain their purchasing power and the economy can eventually grow positively,"" he said on Friday. Manpower Minister Ida Fauziyah said that the government had implemented tax incentives and planned to relax premium payments to the Workers Social Security Agency (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) to support companies so that they could continue employing workers during the outbreak. The ministry, Ida said, was pushing for dialogue between stakeholders “to discuss issues related to tackling COVID-19 and its impacts on business and employment sustainability”. The ministry was also communicating with the regional administrations to prevent and resolve industrial relations disputes. Read also: Indonesia delays deliberations over labor issues in omnibus bill amid backlash A recent deal between the government and lawmakers to delay deliberation on the contentious labor provisions in the omnibus bill on job creation – coupled with COVID-19 restrictions and fears – led workers to scale back May Day rallies across the country on Friday. Many of them used social media instead to reiterate their disapproval of the job creation bill and demand protection during the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. According to Said Iqbal, the MPBI coalition will ask the government to withdraw the bill entirely and resume deliberation only if policymakers allow labor unions to join the drafting process.";

Antara News;Airlangga alumnus provides digital journalism inspiration;"Surabaya (ANTARA) - An alumnus of the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences (FISIP) of Airlangga University, Anak Agung Gde Bagus Wahyu Dhyatmika, is inspiring others through digital journalism, according to a statement from the university on Thursday. Wahyu, the CEO of Tempo Digital, is also active in the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), which promotes press freedom and journalist welfare. In 1997-1998, the era of the student movement, Wahyu was active as a campus journalist. ""So that was one of the experiences that finally forged my journalistic skills,"" he said in the statement. ""It happened to match what I learned in the lecture room."" After graduating from university, he began his journey as a journalist in Jakarta in 2002. As a field reporter, he had to move quickly and dynamically, covering news from various locations such as government offices, courts, police stations, as well as the Parliament. ""It was an unforgettable experience when I could make 10 to 15 news stories a day on various topics,"" he said. ""At that time, it was not difficult because all the sources were in one place, so there was no need to go around. I was walking a little, meeting parliament members, so there was a lot of news,"" he added. In 2004, Wahyu continued his education at the University of Westminster, majoring in International Journalism and Media. After completing his studies, he returned to Tempo and tried to transform the world of digital media. He moved up the ranks of Tempo until he was finally entrusted with the post of CEO. Wahyu committed to maintaining Tempo's independence and journalistic integrity. In addition, he began to develop Tempo as one of the early pioneers of digital media in Indonesia. ""One of the characteristics of digital media is that the public is interactive. We can no longer just be one-way. The public must be involved, the public must be active, there must be engagement, and the editorial team must involve readers,"" he said. In addition, Wahyu has been active in developing educational innovations through the YouTube channel Kok Bisa. He has also developed Tempo Witness, an innovative platform for empowering local or marginalized communities that collaborates with various community projects such as Internews' Earth Journalism Network, Hivos, and the WWF, among others. With this success, as an alumnus, Wahyu said he hopes that Airlangga University will continue to be a pioneer and symbol of openness. He wants to see Unair graduates spread across various sectors, becoming agents of change in every field they are engaged in. ""Continue to be a fun, inclusive, open, non-dogmatic place to learn. The best campus is one that gives its students the opportunity to learn and make mistakes,"" he added.";
Antara News;Indonesia lawmakers say Indigenous rights bill inching closer;"- Indonesia's parliament could pass a long-awaited Indigenous rights bill this year that would help protect communities and critical ecosystems, according to lawmakers and activists. The bill, which has been languishing in the legislature for more than 14 years, has been placed on a list of top priority bills for 2025 called Prolegnas. It would replace a patchwork of laws that has failed to secure land rights for Indigenous communities which have long been subject to human rights abuses, including land grabbing, that create displacement and food insecurity. The bill would grant much-needed legal rights and recognition of land and natural resources, according to supporters. ""Over the years, Indigenous communities have been facing legal uncertainty, and they have been marginalised as a result,"" said Arzeti Bilbina, a member of the National Awakening Party (PKB) in the country's ruling coalition. ""That's why we're pushing to pass the bill hopefully this year,"" she told Context. ""It has been long overdue.""

""The absence of legal protection brings inequalities,"" said Syamsul Alam Agus of the Coalition to Guard the Indigenous Peoples Bill, a coalition of several Indonesian non-profits. ""So it's urgent to pass the bill."" Granting rights to their living space would expand the role of Indigenous communities in biodiversity and nature conservation because they have been practicing sustainable land use and stewardship for generations, Agus added. Indigenous communities across Indonesia were involved in 687 cases of land conflicts with the state and the private sector in the last 10 years, the Nusantara Indigenous Peoples Alliance (AMAN) advocacy organisation said in December. These disputes covered more than 27 million acres of customary land and saw almost 1,000 Indigenous people arrested without charges or jailed for ""obstructing national interests,"" AMAN said. ""The ratification of the Indigenous Peoples bill will provide legal certainty while creating equitable investment for all parties,"" said Muhammad Arman, AMAN's Director of Legal Advocacy.

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan Indigenous Balik tribe's children react to camera as they walk along a road at their village, located near the Indonesia's projected new capital known as Nusantara National Capital, in Sepaku, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia, March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan Indigenous communities often do not benefit from government or private projects because they are not considered the rightful owners of customary land and have often been displaced and unable to access their source of livelihoods, he added. ""So it is a way to ensure Indigenous communities are not left behind in investments or projects,” Arman said. The Indigenous Peoples bill was submitted to the House of Representatives in 2010 and has been included in the Prolegnas three times already, but lawmakers have failed to discuss or pass it into law, for which they must be unanimously agreed. At least two political parties in the House of Representatives -- the Golkar Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) -- have rejected the bill in the past, saying it would hamper investment and obstruct national interests. The PDI-P did not respond to repeated requests for comment, while Golkar Party said it would follow all procedures and evaluate the bill this year. The Coalition said it was optimistic that the bill would be passed this year after recent discussions with members of the legislature indicated no substantial objections. ""So the chance to be passed is wide open, but we still need support from the public,"" said Veni Siregar, a Coalition coordinator. Disputed boundaries Indigenous rights are currently recognised and protected in piecemeal fashion in Indonesia, from a constitutional amendment in 2000 to various national and regional laws. The proposed bill would override existing laws which overlap and have failed to provide legal protection and certainty, said Joeni Arianto Kurniawan, director of Center for Legal Pluralism Studies at Airlangga University in Indonesia. ""It's a mess, because government ministries have their own laws and regulations to follow, which in the end jeopardise the life of Indigenous communities,"" Kurniawan said. He said the bill would provide for greater social, economic and political participation by Indigenous people on the national level while providing a mechanism to resolve conflicts. Indigenous communities can find it difficult to formally register customary land and forests due to bureaucracy and disputed boundaries with the state or with corporations, experts noted. Rukmini Paata Toheke, an activist from the Ngata Toro Indigenous community in Central Sulawesi, has been fighting for the ratification of the bill for more a decade. She said her community has been practicing nature conservation for generations but is threatened by development and illegal activities such as poaching, logging and mining. ""If the bill is passed, we hope that we have greater role in conserving nature and our way of life,"" she said.";
Antara News;A research shows we might be ingesting anywhere from dozens to more than 100,000 microplastic particles each day depending on what we consume and the amounts;"Scientists are warning against grave long-term consequences. Researchers are increasingly worried about microplastics – plastic particles smaller than 5 millimetres across – and if they can damage human health. Studies show they are widespread in our environment – in everyday products in homes and offices; in oceans, rivers, the soil and even in rain over cities. Over time, people ingest or inhale more of these chemicals than they expel, a process that leads to bioaccumulation in bodies. These specks are small enough to enter our cells or tissues and their toxicity may cause diseases. A recent analysis identified more than 10,000 unique chemicals used in plastics, many not properly regulated globally. And research shows we might be ingesting anywhere from dozens to more than 100,000 microplastic particles each day depending on what we consume and the amounts. Microplastics have now been found in fish, deep inside the lungs of surgical patients and in the blood of anonymous donors and breast milk. While there have been no epidemiologic studies confirming a link between exposure to microplastics and impacts on health, researchers point out chemicals found in plastic have been linked to a range of health problems including cancer, heart disease, obesity and poor foetal development. High levels of microplastics in our bodies may also cause cell damage. “… there is overwhelming consensus among all stakeholders that microplastics do not belong in the environment and measures should be taken to mitigate exposure,” says the World Health Organisation. How worried should we be about microplastics in our bodies? What is the current state of research and what are the challenges faced by experts in the field? And what solutions can we start to employ now to mitigate more extensive hazards both known and unknown? Reality Check The consumption of micro and nano plastics represents a health risk that could be ‘irreversible’, researchers say in a warning about the pollution. Humans take in five grammes of plastic particles each week – about the weight of a credit card. In Sri Lanka, researchers found that people are exposed to airborne microplastic particles which are between 1 and 28 times higher indoors compared to outdoor environments. Plastics in livestock feed result in microplastics in the meat and dairy we consume every day. Scientists detected plastic particles in 18 of 25 milk samples tested in the Netherlands and in some seven out of eight beef samples. Microplastics can transform other pollutants into a more harmful form. Microplastic-contaminated UV filters used in cosmetic products, for example, make chromium metal more toxic. Big Ideas Quote attributable to Thava Palanisami, University of Newcastle, Australia “Identifying and quantifying fine microplastics less than 1mm is a key challenge facing researchers. Standardising analytical methods and parameters for samples is needed.” Quote attributable to Lee Yeong Yeh, Universiti Sains Malaysia “While more research is needed, the evidence so far is clear microplastics are a potentially serious human health hazard. Therefore everyone plays a role in curbing plastic pollution.” Quote attributable to Veryl Hasan, Airlangga University, Indonesia “It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic waste than fish in the sea. Microplastics which fish consume have already been found in humans. We urgently need to reduce our plastic use.” Quote attributable to Murthy Chavali, Alliance University, India “With evidence of the increased consumption of single-use plastics, notably, face masks during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is critical to push and invest in more detailed research on the impact of microplastics on our health";
Antara News;Elon Musk’s Starlink in Indonesia: opportunity or threat?;The presence of Elon Musk at Bali’s 10th World Water Forum (WWF) has captured national attention, not only because of Musk’s controversial handling of X (formerly Twitter) but also due to his unexpected offer to the Indonesian government: his satellite-based Starlink internet service. Starlink was officially unveiled last week during the WWF’s opening ceremony, where Musk also garnered significant attention. The service has been met with great enthusiasm, despite its high costs. In response, Jakarta quickly applauded Musk’s offer, which promises speeds of up to 300 Mbps—far faster than current Indonesian providers, which still rely on BTS (Base Transceiver Station) technology. However, the deployment of BTS across Indonesia’s vast archipelago, especially in remote areas, has been marred by a major corruption scandal involving the Ministry for Communication and Information (Kominfo), resulting in losses of half a billion dollars. Now, with Elon Musk’s presentation of Starlink, the ongoing BTS project faces potential delays. This has raised significant business and security concerns. Nono, a sociologist, said, “Elon Musk’s Starlink poses a serious challenge to our local internet providers.” Unlike traditional satellites positioned over 35,000 km from Earth, Starlink’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are less than 500 km away, providing stronger and more accessible signals. Additionally, Starlink devices are user-friendly and portable, requiring only an electrical connection to operate. Despite these advantages, the cost remains a barrier for many Indonesians. The initial price of the device is 7.8 million IDR (approximately $520), with a monthly fee of 750,000 IDR (around $55) for residential users, though it is more affordable for large companies. Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin has endorsed Starlink for enhancing the country’s e-health and telemedicine programs, especially in remote health service centers (Puskesmas). However, the lack of reliable electricity in these areas poses another significant challenge, as generators are expensive to operate. National security concerns have also been raised. Mr. Garuda Sugardo and Mr. Henry Subiakto, a professor at Airlangga University and former Kominfo specialist, have both expressed fears about Starlink’s impact. Subiakto argues that Starlink could threaten national communication assets and potentially aid separatist groups due to its portability and advanced technology, which differs significantly from Indonesia’s existing communication satellites like INDOSTAR-2, PALAPA D, TELKOM, PSN VR-2, and BRIsat. Starlink’s innovative technology, which utilizes phased-array antennas, allows for signal transmission without the need for a dedicated satellite, making the devices as portable as small laptops. This flexibility, while beneficial in many respects, also introduces new challenges and threats to national security and integrity.;

tempo;Unair Alumni Wins Two International Awards for Research on the Film Bidaah;"Aidatul Fitriyah, an alumnus of the Faculty of Humanities at Airlangga University (Unair) from Indonesia, won two international awards at the 3rd International Article Writing Competition held by Multimedia University, Malaysia, on July 20, 2025. She received the awards for her research on the film Bidaah. Aidatul won the first category in Language and Communication. She and her colleague, Ahmad Harith Irfan, an alumnus of the University of Malaya, won first place in this category. The second award was in the Media Criticism category. Aidatul and Ahmad Dailami Fadhil, a student at Sidi Ben Abdellah University in Morocco, won second place. Aidatul had her own reasons for researching and criticizing the Malaysian drama series. According to her, ""Bidaah"" boldly depicts the practice of preserving religion within closed communities. Aidatul said the issues depicted in the film raised concerns about the rise of religious deviations. Moreover, these events often escape open criticism. ""Through film as a popular medium, we can uncover how power operates symbolically and hidden within the guise of spirituality,"" said Aidatul. He believes that research that stems from intellectual unease has more potential to raise public awareness. ""This isn't just about religious representation, but about how religion is exploited to subjugate human reason, body, and will,"" he said. Aidatul also hopes that the findings of his analysis will not simply be academic documents but can become impactful critical discourse. ""This achievement isn't just about prestige, but about validation of hard work and the courage to think critically to side with the oppressed,"" said the 2024 Unair Outstanding Graduate. Aidatul and his team wrote two studies with different approaches to the film Bidaah. The first study used Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis theory to examine how language, symbols, and visuals are used as tools of ideological domination. The second study used an analytical approach from the perspective of Islamic theology and Islamic jurisprudence. This approach, he said, was used to critique the deviant religious doctrine depicted in the film Bidaah. He explained that both studies were conducted intensively through textual and visual analysis of each scene. The goal was to explore how religious authority is used as a tool of domination, shaping deviant doctrine within the framework of social discourse.";
tempo;Unair Team Wins Gold in International Competition with IoT-Based Work Fatigue Measurement Device;"The Indonesian students team from Airlangga University (Unair) has achieved a proud accomplishment in an international competition. In the International Invention and Innovation Competition (I3C) 2025, the Unair team successfully won a gold medal on Sunday, March 10, 2025. The team consists of Ibrahim Al Khawwas, Nasywa Dhiyaul Haq, Diva Firnanda Azzahra (Faculty of Vocational Studies); Imamul Aziz (Faculty of Pharmacy); and Farhan Aldan Khairian (Faculty of Science and Technology). They successfully competed with 1,500 teams from various countries online in a competition with the theme of ""Empowering Minds, Transforming Futures"" organized by the Malaysia Innovation Invention Creativity Association (MIICA). In this competition, they came up with the Smart Timer Reaction (STIREACT) to measure standardized global work fatigue. The STIREACT innovation is based on the issue of work fatigue, which can occur in various sectors and cause a decrease in productivity and potential work accidents. Currently, there are work fatigue measurement tools that are not integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT). ""These two factors underpin our decision to elevate the innovation of work fatigue measurement devices integrated with IoT,"" Ibrahim said in a written statement on Thursday, March 13, 2025. Ibrahim stated that they collected their data using IoT-based STIREACT devices, supported by interviews and surveys. Subsequently, the data was analyzed using internationally standardized work fatigue measurement tools. The results showed that the STIREACT device has a high level of accuracy in measuring work fatigue. International Competition Strategy Ibrahim explained that in participating in international competitions, ensuring the uniqueness and innovation using international literature and patents is essential. ""This is to ensure that STIREACT has never been created before and has advantages over existing technology,"" he said. Furthermore, team strengthening and collaboration are also important in maximizing task assignments involving supervisors. In addition, time management and intensive training to create a good competition timeline are crucial to ensure that all aspects of the competition are well-prepared. Facing Challenges Winning an international championship is not easy. One of the challenges they faced was adjusting the design and IoT technology to function accurately and optimally. The results also had to be validated with internationally standardized work fatigue measurement tools. Ibrahim said another challenge they faced was balancing time between competition preparation, academics, and organization because their team consisted of a combination of three faculties. ""Funding is also important, so there needs to be financial support for the development of devices and research,"" he said. He stated that becoming an international champion is an extraordinary experience. Consistency, innovation, and hard work are the keys to victory. ""We hope that this research innovation can benefit others, in line with our principle of staying humble regardless of our position,"" he said";

Unair Public Relations Document TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Airlangga University (Unair) students earn an achievement in an international competition, namely the Silver Medal International Creative & Innovative Idea Competition 2025, which was won online on Sunday, February 9, 2025. The team consists of Isac Muhammad K Gibran (S1-Aquaculture, Faculty of Health, Medicine, and Natural Sciences/FIKKIA), Laurent Mercy Pankito (S1-Aquaculture, FIKKIA), Iftitah Ahdani Zuhri (S1, Aquaculture FIKKIA), Nashwa Mawla Audyia (S1-Veterinary Medicine, FIKKIA), and Habib Anwash (D4-Informatics Engineering, Faculty of Vocational Studies). They initiated an innovation in an aerial pesticide spreader based on motion control with a cable driven robot concept called 'Adichine'. Cable and Motion Control Based Robot Team member, Iftitah, said that global pest attacks have reduced agricultural production by 40 percent. Until now, farmers have sprayed pesticides manually or via drones which are expensive and have limited range. Adichine is here as an innovation in aerial pesticide spreading tools based on motion control with a cable driven robot concept. The tool offers a more precise, affordable, and environmentally friendly system automation. ""Adichine can help increase agricultural productivity, keep food supplies stable and food security more secure. This technology is more efficient, cheaper, and optimal than conventional or drones,"" said Iftitah in a written statement, Thursday, February 13, 2025. Adichine can move in a controlled and precise manner thanks to motion control technology. With a cable driven robot system, the tool can reach a wider agricultural area by reducing excessive spraying. According to him, Adichine is different from spraying drones which require expensive batteries and routine maintenance. The use of a cable system makes it more energy efficient. ""With a motion control system and cable driven robot, Adichine reduces crop losses due to pests such as brown planthoppers,"" he said. More precise pesticide control can maintain ecosystem balance. A green economy based on agriculture for future generations will also have a broad impact on sustainable food security. Innovation and New Opportunities Iftitah hopes that Adichine will not only be an innovation, but also a real solution for farmers in Indonesia. With this technology, Adichine opens up new business opportunities in the field of agricultural technology, thus creating jobs for technicians, engineers, and distributors of modern agricultural equipment. Farmers are also more productive with the application of modern technology without fear of pest attacks. ""Not only helping large-scale farmers, but also small rural farmers to enjoy the benefits of modern technology. We also hope that Adichine contributes to realizing more sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture,"" he said.";

tempo;COVID-19 Cases Rise Again: Unair Expert Warns of Virus Mutations, Vaccine Gaps;"A recent uptick in COVID-19 cases is once again drawing concern. Agung Dwi Wahyu Widodo, an immunology expert at Airlangga University's Faculty of Medicine, said that while the current wave isn't nearly as severe as the pandemic's peak, the public should not let their guard down. Agung said that while today's COVID-19 situation may be milder, the threat remains real. That's why he urged the public to remain alert. ""We went through the pandemic around four years ago. While a small rise in cases can be considered normal, we need to be cautious because the virus may not have truly disappeared. It has only mutated to spread more easily, even if the symptoms are milder,"" he wrote in a statement on Wednesday, June 11. The Rise of Nimbus Agung pointed to three key drivers behind the latest surge: new variants, waning population immunity, and post-pandemic behavioral shifts. Together, they've created the perfect set up for another round of community spread. ""This new variant is a result of Omicron mutations, ranging from JN.1 to NB.1.8.1. The NB.1.8.1 variant is known as Nimbus. Nimbus has a significantly different spike protein structure compared to earlier Omicron variants,"" he said. Weather shifts, he noted, have also played a role in weakening people’s immune systems. What should have been a dry season has instead turned cold and rainy, which is an ideal condition for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the early days of the global outbreak. ""This seasonal shift has triggered a drop in people’s immunity. At the same time, many believe Covid-19 is no longer around, so they've started ignoring health protocols. But just because testing isn't happening doesn’t mean the virus is truly gone,"" he said. With limited testing and contact tracing, Agung warned that many people may be infected without realizing it, brushing off coughs and colds that could actually be Covid, which is usually how silent, hard-to-control outbreaks started. Old Vaccines, New Problems The virus may have moved on, but the vaccines haven't. Agung said older COVID-19 vaccines are no longer effective at stopping newer strains like Nimbus or Omicron. ""Just like the seasonal flu, we need updated vaccines that match these new variants. That's the only way to boost protection,"" he said. In the meantime, Agung urged people to take responsibility for their own health: eat well, get enough rest, exercise within their limits, and reduce stress. He added that implementing basic COVID-19 protocols still works, such as wearing a mask in crowded public spaces.";

The Dean of FISIP Unair argued that the flower arrangement was unethical. From photos circulated on social media, the flower arrangement was rectangular and featured pictures of the elected president and vice president, Prabowo-Gibran. The board was inscribed with 'Congratulations on the inauguration of General Ruthless Human Rights Violator and 2.3 GPA Professor as President and Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia born from an unconstitutional womb'. At the bottom of Prabowo's photo, it was labeled Chief of Mawar Team. Meanwhile, under Gibran's photo, it was signed Admin Fufufafa. Additionally, there was a note 'From: Mulyono (Democracy Destroyer Scoundrel). The President of BEM FISIP Unair, Tuffahati Ulayyah confirmed that their organization is currently frozen due to the flower arrangement. 'Yes, since Friday, October 25, 2024 (frozen),' Tufa told Tempo, on Saturday, October 26, 2024. Tufa then explained the chronology. According to him, the flower arrangement did indeed come from the initiative of BEM FISIP Unair and was set up since Tuesday, October 22, 2024, at 3:00 PM WIB. The message on the flower arrangement aimed to express disappointment over the series of events during the 2024 Election. 'We intentionally placed it in the FISIP Unair campus garden to attract attention. It also went viral on social media,' Tufa said. The placement of the flower arrangement led to the summons of BEM FISIP Unair by the faculty's ethics committee on Friday, October 25, 2024, at 9:30 AM WIB. They were summoned to provide clarification. During the summoning session, BEM Unair was asked about ownership and the possibility of involvement of external parties in creating the flower arrangement. 'We responded that there was no involvement of external parties,' Tufa said. On the same day at 4:13 PM WIB, BEM FISIP Unair received an email from the Dean's office stating that the student organization was frozen. The letter mentioned that the flower arrangement installation on the FISIP Unair grounds was done without permission and coordination with the faculty. Furthermore, the letter also stated that 'The narrative used in the flower arrangement is not in line with the ethics and academic culture of campus individuals'. At the end of the letter, it was written 'The Dean of FISIP Unair Decided that the Management of BEM FISIP Unair is frozen starting today and awaits the issuance of the next Dean's Decision of FISIP Unair. The letter was also signed by the Dean of FISIP Unair, Bagong Suyanto with a copy to seven campus officials, including the Rector of Unair. Furthermore, BEM FISIP Unair responded to the letter by contacting the Dean of FISIP Unair. ""We are allowed to meet with the Dean on Monday, October 28";
tempo;Unair Marine Expert: Sea Fences Potentially Damage Ecological and Economic Order of Coastal Communities;"The Indonesian ocean, which stretches as one of the largest maritime riches in the world, is now considered to be facing serious problems with the emergence of cases of building sea fences based on Building Use Rights (HGB). Dean of the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, Airlangga University (Unair) Muhammad Amin Alamsjah said, from a maritime perspective, the action of installing HGB sea fences not only harms social justice, but also has the potential to damage the ecological and economic order of coastal communities. Amin said this action contradicts Article 33 Paragraph 3 of the 1945 Constitution. ""The land and water and the natural resources contained therein are controlled by the state and used for the greatest prosperity of the people. This means that sea areas cannot be owned privately or by companies,"" said Amin in a written statement, Monday, January 27, 2025. Ecosystem Threatened, Fishermen Affected Amin said the construction of this sea fence not only violates constitutional principles, but also risks causing damage to the aquatic ecosystem. According to him, restrictions on sea fences can accelerate sedimentation, reduce the carrying capacity of water areas and damage nursery grounds. ""The long-term impact is that it damages the nursery ground of fish seeds and threatens the habitat of marine biota such as coral reefs and seagrass beds,"" he said. Fishermen who depend on marine resources for their daily livelihoods also face serious threats. With limited access due to sea fences, they must find new areas to go to sea, which are often far from home and require higher operational costs. ""Coastal areas that are a source of livelihood for traditional fishermen can be degraded. As a result, fisheries productivity decreases and people's livelihoods are disrupted,"" he said. Conflict of Interest in the Maritime Zone Amin said that Indonesia has internationally recognized maritime boundaries, ranging from territorial waters to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). According to him, privatization actions like this create conflicts of interest that conflict with the function of the sea as a unifying medium for the nation and a supporter of collective community welfare. ""Sea areas must be utilized for the common good, not for the benefit of a handful of parties. When its management violates the law or harms the wider community, the state has the authority to cancel the policy,"" he said. Returning the Sea for All The HGB sea fence case, Amin said, is a reminder that the sea is not just a physical space, but also a source of life for millions of Indonesians. He emphasized that violations of the maritime order must be stopped. ""If the construction of the HGB sea fence violates the law and harms the people, then the state is obliged to take firm action to cancel it,"" he said. In the future, Amin said, marine protection must be a national priority. ""As a maritime country, Indonesia has a great responsibility to ensure that the ocean remains a blessing for all its people, not just the property of a handful of parties,"" he said";
tempo;IDI Chief: Foreign Doctors Cannot Enter Indiscriminately;THE controversy surrounding the policy on foreign doctors caused the Dean of Medicine at Airlangga University, Budi Santoso to lose his position in the first week of July. The obstetrician was allegedly fired for his criticism of the government’s plan to open the door to overseas doctors. The dismissal was eventually annulled after the university’s Rector Mohammad Nasih reinstated Budi on Wednesday, July 10. To Mohammad Adib Khumaidi, Chair of the Indonesian Medical Association (IDI), criticisms such as that of his colleague from Airlangga University are quite normal in the medical world. He said doctors spoke out for the sake of patient safety. “The state shouldn’t have problems with academic freedom,” he said on July 11. The plan to allow foreign doctors into Indonesia was proposed by Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin. The former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bank Mandiri argued that the presence of foreign doctors could improve the quality of healthcare services, enhance the competence of local doctors, and help patients with heart diseases. Adib said that simply bringing in overseas doctors would not solve the problems. “We have to overcome problems such as inability (of patients), funding and infrastructure,” the orthopedist argued. In an over one-hour-long interview with Tempo reporters, Sunudyantoro and Yosea Arga Pramudita at the IDI headquarters in Menteng, Central Jakarta, Adib also explained his agency’s relationship with the health minister in recent times. “There are parties who took the opportunity to position IDI as being constantly at odds with the government,” he asserted. Excerpts of the interview: The Health Ministry is opening up opportunities for overseas doctors to come and work in Indonesia. Is it an appropriate step? What needs to be highlighted is the restriction of practices stipulated in the regulations of each country.  Bilateral agreements are necessary for people to work in certain countries. Foreign doctors cannot just enter indiscriminately before the government has these agreements. Why are agreements important? Via agreements, requirements should be set and fulfilled. Let me give you an example. Singapore requires foreign workers to possess special qualifications. Only graduates from certain universities such as Malaysia, Australia, the United Kingdom, etc. can work there. They have the list. They also stipulate that foreign doctors must first work in general hospitals, not immediately in private hospitals. What is the reason for such a process? Foreign doctors are first supervised in general hospitals. Only afterward are they allowed to practice medicine in private hospitals. That’s the domestic regulation of the Singapore government to protect its citizens. Do we not have yet such strict regulations albeit the plan to open up opportunities for foreign doctors? There was a Health Minister Regulation concerning the evaluation of a doctor’s clinical practice skills. We need to strengthen these regulations. What is the importance of regulations when foreign doctors enter the country? It is the requirements that will protect the safety of our patients or citizens as the regulation will ensure that these doctors don’t have disciplinary records or legal or ethical problems. Weren’t there already precedents of foreign doctors practicing medicine in Jakarta? The Jakarta Health Office once deployed a team to monitor a foreign doctor. We received a report on that doctor and then wrote to the authorities in his country of origin. He was summoned back home and sanctioned. A violation like this is only known to peer groups. The point is that professional organizations and specialist associations must be involved. Which countries could be used as benchmarks for regulations on the employment of foreign doctors? Every country has its own domestic regulations. The majority of the countries have almost the same rules. The primary requirement is a letter of good standing. Second, competency evaluation. We should not let people come claiming to be specialists only to find out later that they are not. The UK has the General Medical Council, a public agency that regulates medical practices. They just verified with us the status of an Indonesian doctor who wanted to work there. Doctors treat patients and help make life-and-death decisions for patients so there needs to be strict regulations and background checks.;

Ubedilah Badrun, a sociology professor at the Jakarta State University, said that the hoisting of the pirate flag with a straw hat does not need to be overreacted by the government. Especially, it should not be interpreted as an attempt of subversion and the like. ""But from a political sociology standpoint, every visible symbol in the public arena, including on social media, is an expression of the citizens to convey something,"" Ubedilah said when contacted on Sunday, August 3, 2025. He stated that the raising of the One Piece flag is a means of political and social expression for the community, especially the younger generation. According to him, the younger generation is more familiar with popular cultural symbols to express their grievances. Ubedilah mentioned that in the past five years, almost all criticisms or aspirations towards the government have consistently used specific symbols. For example, the blue Garuda symbol during the Indonesia Darurat (Emergency Indonesia) movement, the black Garuda icon during the Indonesia Gelap (Dark Indonesia) movement, and so on. ""All of these symbols carry meaning as signs of criticism or resistance against the government,"" said Ubedilah. He explained that through these symbols, the people express various aspirations. He provided examples of some of these aspirations, such as to prevent the weakening of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), eradicate corruption to its roots, reject nepotism, meaningful participation in the making of laws, not manipulating laws or the constitution for power, not damaging democracy, uphold law and justice, provide decent living rights for laborers, not to damage the environment, and so on. All of these demands are still relevant to this day. ""So, if a new symbol of resistance appears in the form of the One Piece flag, I interpret it as a citizen's expression of critique or resistance against injustice and the social conditions felt by the people over the past five years until now,"" said Ubedilah. ""They are disappointed and fed up with the political situation that has not seriously fought for the rights of the people."" As a symbol of particular political messages, he continued, the raising of the One Piece flag is similar to the aspirations or participation of citizens. This is the right of citizens guaranteed by the constitution. He stated that from a symbolic point of view in political sociology, the One Piece flag is not just a product of an anime. ""But it has become a tool for conveying messages about the hope for justice and change."" Therefore, he advised the government not to respond to it negatively. Especially not to overreact. The same sentiment was expressed by Bagong Suyanto, a sociology professor at Airlangga University. He stated that the raising of the One Piece flag is a form of symbolic resistance. ""It is a protest symbol that the Indonesian people are being colonized, losing their freedom,"" said Bagong in a short message on Sunday, August 3, 2025. He believes the government needs to respond with objective data, not just a war of narratives. ""If it is only refuted without data, it's hard for the public to accept,"" said Bagong, especially if it is simply silenced. ""So, a healthy dialogue space is needed."" One resident from Riau, Kharik Anhar, also hoisted the pirate flag with a straw hat. He was undeterred by the criminal threats issued by the government for those who raise the One Piece flag. ""There is no article that prohibits people from hoisting flags of figures, football clubs, or animations at home or on vehicles,"" said Kharik when contacted on Sunday, August 3, 2025. He also gathered other residents and students from various regions. Kharik consolidated the campaign to raise the pirate flag so that it could be displayed massively in front of houses and spread through social media. At least, there are already 320 people involved in this campaign for hoisting the pirate flag";
tempo;Social Media Brings Young Indonesians In from Political Fringe;"Rachmah Ida, a professor in the Department of Media and Communication, Airlangga University, Indonesia Social media has become a powerful tool for younger Indonesian voters to engage with a political system that otherwise leaves them at the margins. When Hillary Brigitta Lasut was elected to Indonesia's House of Representatives in 2019, she credited social media for her success. With 77,000 followers on her official Instagram campaign account and 248,000 followers on her personal account, she received more than 70,000 votes to be elected to represent North Sulawesi. As a general election approaches in 2024, social media in Indonesia has become an essential way for political parties and politicians to engage with their constituents, increase their popularity — and win votes. A big part of this effort centers on the youth vote. About 53 percent of Indonesia's 270 million people fall within the age groups of Generation Z and the Millennials — groups overwhelmingly aged under 40. With most of this demographic of voting age, there will be fierce competition for young voters ahead of the 2024 general election. According to the 2020 census, Gen Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, makeup about 26.5 percent of the population, and Millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996, just under 26 percent. Young people are also the most active users of social media, which has become an alternative outlet for political participation. That can be through comments, likes or criticism directed at public figures, political elites, or influential people, and it has helped younger voices on public affairs and political issues become a bigger part of the debates. Yet young people remain marginalized in the national political arena in terms of their representation in policymaking. President Joko Widodo tried to include youth representation by selecting seven high-profile millennials as special staff to participate in regular meetings. But their thoughts or recommendations have not been heard since. Based on a 2020 survey on social media and political engagement among youth, social media has enabled them to follow and participate in political news. Out of 233 samples, 58.3 percent of respondents have engaged in online political discussions. Youth respondents were more likely to believe that they could contribute to the political shift of their country. Almost two-thirds — 63 percent — of respondents believed that young people could change the political scenario. The survey also shows that young people are critical and use their knowledge and intellect to choose candidates. They do not want to give away their vote for nothing: a candidate's track record and vision for change is important. A JakPat survey in 2022 found that YouTube was the most frequented platform, used by 82 percent of respondents, followed by Facebook and Instagram at 77 percent, with 56 percent of users 15–29 years old. Among the age group 15–24, TikTok was the most used platform (43 percent), followed by Twitter (30 percent). Social media might also be driving more young people to vote. According to one survey, Millennials made up 35 to 40 percent of voters in the 2019 election, or about 80 million out of 185 million voters nationwide. There are various political activities where youth activists shape their political views through social media: 68 percent of youth respondents said they like to participate in online forums because it is easy to contribute to the discussions of political affairs. Interest in politics is also important for tracking political activism among youth, who are often accused of political apathy. An overwhelming 84.5 percent of poll respondents were ""highly interested"" in politics and participating in online debates, with only 15.5 percent ""fairly interested"". Respondents were also more interested in following national news (47.7 percent) than international news (29.5 percent) or local and regional news (23.3 percent). With young people in Indonesia frequently engaged in online politics, their participation in the 2024 election could see them become active political content producers. Social media and peers are two significant sources for political preference for the students. In contrast to older generations, who often followed their parents' political preferences when voting, younger generations rely on social media and the influence of peers to make up their minds.";
tempo;"Foreign Doctor Policy Sparks Debate; Health Minister Explains";The government's plan to address the shortage of medical professionals by bringing in foreign doctors has ignited controversy. Professor Budi Santoso, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Airlangga University (Unair) in Surabaya, Indonesia, was recently dismissed for publicly opposing the policy. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin defended the initiative, emphasizing its primary objective: saving the lives of roughly 12,000 babies born with congenital heart defects each year. “We have more than 12,000 babies with congenital heart defects each year,” he said after an internal meeting with President Jokowi at the Presidential Palace Complex in Jakarta on Tuesday, July 2, 2024. He highlighted the limited capacity of Indonesian doctors to perform heart surgeries, currently serving only around 6,000 patients annually. Congenital heart defects, however, often require prompt surgical intervention. “If these 6,000 babies are not treated, they have a high risk of dying. The risk will be even higher if we just wait,” he added. Law No. 17 of 2023 on Health regulates the process for foreign medical personnel to practice in Indonesia. Budi emphasized that the influx of foreign doctors is solely aimed at saving the lives of these vulnerable infants. While acknowledging some resistance, Budi addressed concerns about the quality of foreign doctors compared to domestic professionals. He acknowledged that there might be a sentiment that Indonesian doctors are superior and can handle the situation. “This isn't about diminishing their abilities.” Budi believed that Indonesian doctors are capable of handling heart surgery, but emphasized the sheer volume of cases exceeds their current capacity. “We can't afford to wait. We bring in foreign doctors to save these 6,000 babies and mothers who would be devastated if their babies have congenital heart defects,” he said. Additionally, Indonesia's current ratio of general practitioners is only 0.47 per 1,000 people, falling far short of the global average of 1.76. Reaching the doctor-to-patient ratio of developed nations would require an additional 140,000 doctors. Uneven distribution further exacerbates the issue. Many areas, especially outside Java, face a severe lack of doctors. Approximately 500 health centers are currently without a doctor on staff. The Indonesian Medical Association (IDI) Weighs In The debate over foreign doctors has been ongoing since 2020. At the time, the focus was on developing Indonesia's healthcare system into a health tourism destination. Slamet Budiarto, Deputy Chairperson of the IDI, urged the government to prioritize optimizing the potential of Indonesian doctors rather than easing restrictions for foreign doctors. “The quality of our doctors is on par with those abroad,” Slamet told Tempo on Saturday, August 29, 2020. According to him, the disparity in healthcare quality stems from Indonesia's limited access to advanced medical equipment. “[Developed countries] offer tax exemptions on medical devices and medicines, making them significantly cheaper,” he said. In contrast, Indonesia imposes high taxes on medical equipment, making it unaffordable for hospitals to purchase sophisticated devices. Additionally, health financing falls short compared to developed nations. Slamet proposed a four-point plan to strengthen the Indonesian medical field. First, eliminate taxes on medical devices and medicines. Second, implement rational healthcare financing policies. Third, encourage Indonesian graduates from top universities abroad to return and contribute their expertise. Fourth, improve the healthcare system infrastructure. “By taking these steps, Indonesia’s medical world will advance and there will be no need for foreign doctors,” Slamet concluded.;
tempo;Indonesia's Purbaya Says Govt Will Run Rupiah Redenomination 'In Due Time';"The Indonesian government and Bank Indonesia are once again discussing the redenomination of the rupiah. Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said this policy falls under the authority of the central bank. ""This is the central bank's policy. The central bank has already given a statement. Don't keep pestering me,"" he told media crew at Airlangga University in Surabaya on Monday, November 10, 2025. Purbaya emphasized that the central bank will implement the rupiah denomination policy in due time, but not in the near future. ""Not now, not next year,"" said Purbaya. Bank Indonesia has revealed its rationale behind the government's proposed Draft Law on Changes in Rupiah Prices, commonly referred to as redenomination. The draft law has been included in the 2025–2029 National Medium-Term Legislative Program as a government-initiated proposal based on Bank Indonesia’s recommendation. Ramdan Denny Prakoso, Head of BI’s Communication Department, explained that redenomination involves simplifying the number of digits in the rupiah without reducing its purchasing power or value against goods and services. “This is a strategic step to improve transaction efficiency, enhance the credibility of the rupiah, and support the modernization of the national payment system,” Denny said in a written statement on Monday, November 10, 2025. Denny emphasized that the timing of implementation will carefully consider political, economic, and social stability, as well as technical readiness, including legal, logistical, and information technology preparations. He added that BI will continue to focus on maintaining the rupiah’s value stability and supporting economic growth throughout the redenomination process. He also stressed that the process is being meticulously planned and involves coordination with all stakeholders. “Bank Indonesia, together with the government and the People’s Representative Council, will continue to discuss the technical and policy aspects of the redenomination,” Denny said. The redenomination plan is outlined in the Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) Number 70 of 2025 on the Ministry of Finance’s Strategic Plan for 2025–2029. The regulation was enacted on November 3, 2025, and signed by Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa. The PMK states that the Draft Law on Changes in Rupiah Prices is expected to be finalized by 2027.";
tempo;Proposal to Place the National Police Under Home Affairs Ministry Draws Criticisms;"The proposed notion to place the National Police (Polri) under the Ministry of Home Affairs has invited a series of criticisms. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) was one of the supporters of this proposal, which was brought up under the issue of neutrality and national security. PDIP chief Deddy Yevri Sitorus suspected the involvement of police in the victories of several running candidates in the recent regional election, which he referred to as the “brown party.” Deddy reckoned some members of the police—not limited to one person—have damaged the democracy and considered it an issue of the chain of command. He also accused the National Police Chief General Listyo Sigit Prabowo of being the responsible party, albeit did not provide further details about his finding of alleged fraud linked to the police. A series of criticisms -A step backward According to the Executive Director of the Indonesian Police Strategic Study Institute (Lemkapi), Edi Hasibuan, the idea of placing the police under the Ministry of Home Affairs or the military is a step backward. ""We suggest that the police remain under the president,” Edi said in his statement in Jakarta on Sunday, December 1, 2024. Based on academic studies, he said, the National Police ideally answered to the president. This postgraduate lecturer at Bhayangkara University in Jakarta stated that being under any ministry would not guarantee the improvement of the National Police and instead invited the concern that it would regress. -Deviation from the 1945 Constitution Professor of Law at Airlangga University Surabaya, Suparto Wijoyo, remarked that placing the National Police under the Home Affairs Ministry or the military is a deviation from the 1945 Constitution. ""This is in line with Article 30 of the 1945 Constitution, where the National Police are under the President and directly accountable to the President,"" he said in Surabaya on Sunday, December 1, 2024. Suparto explained that Polri, as an independent state institution, is tasked with maintaining order and security, law enforcement, and protecting the community without direct interference from the government or other ministries. Placing Polri under a ministry, Suparto said, creates a tangible concern of political influence within the police institution. -Political Intervention Member of the House of Representatives (DPR) Commission III, Aboe Bakar Alhabsy, expressed his objection to the proposal of returning the National Police under the Ministry of Home Affairs' jurisdiction. According to him, placing Polri under the Ministry of Home Affairs could potentially result in greater political intervention. Moreover, he said, the National Police being under the Ministry of Home Affairs or the military has been done before in Indonesia. ""There is no need to repeat a past that was less than ideal,"" said the PKS politician, as quoted from a written statement on Sunday, December 1, 2024. Separating Polri from the Ministry of Home Affairs was conducted in 1946, while the separation of police from the Indonesian National Armed Forces occurred in 2000.";
tempo;Tom Lembong's Verdict Widely Criticized, Central Jakarta District Court Opens Up;"The Central Jakarta District Court has finally spoken following various criticisms regarding the 4.5-year prison sentence imposed by the Panel of Judges on the 2015-2016 Trade Minister, Thomas Trikasih Lembong or Tom Lembong last Friday, July 18, 2025. The spokesman for the Central Jakarta District Court, Andi Saputra, stated that the verdict in the sugar import corruption case was purely based on legal facts. The Panel of Judges in the Corruption Court at the Central Jakarta District Court did not succumb to external influence or seek the truth outside the trial in delivering the verdict. ""Whether it's pressure, political issues, and so on, there is none. That is the most important thing, it is not based on intervention or other pressures,"" said Andi in a video statement in Jakarta on Monday, July 21, 2025, as quoted by Antara. He hoped that the public would be patient as the legal process related to the Tom Lembong case is still ongoing, so that parties who are not satisfied with the panel of judges' decision can file an appeal. In addressing various issues on social media and other media, Andi asked the public to read the entire content of the panel of judges' decision. Thus, the public is expected not only to read the mitigating or aggravating considerations, but to read it in a balanced manner in order to understand the essence and reason why the decision was made. ""We thank you for all the criticisms. No matter how harsh the advice and input, it means many still care and love the court,"" he said. In the case of alleged sugar import corruption at the Ministry of Trade in 2015-2016, Tom Lembong was sentenced to 4.5 years in prison after being found guilty of committing corruption, which caused state financial losses amounting to Rp 194.72 billion. The corruption act committed by Tom Lembong included issuing approval for raw crystal sugar imports to 10 companies without the basis of inter-ministerial coordination meetings and without recommendations from the Ministry of Industry. For his actions, Tom Lembong was also fined Rp 750 million, with a subsidiary penalty of 6 months' imprisonment. Tom Lembong was found to have violated Article 2 paragraph (1) of Law Number 31 of 1999 concerning Corruption Eradication as amended and supplemented by Law Number 20 of 2001 juncto Article 55 paragraph (1) of the Criminal Code. The sentence imposed by the Panel of Judges is lower than the prosecutors' demand, which was a 7-year prison sentence. However, the fine imposed remained the same as the demand, which was Rp 750 million with a subsidiary penalty of 6 months' imprisonment. Various Criticisms Legal and development observer from Airlangga University, Hardjuno Wiwoho, believes that the considerations of state losses in Tom Lembong's case should be more detailed and based on actual calculations. ""In the determination of existing losses, what emerges is just a snippet of theory and doctrine,"" said Hardjuno in a statement received in Jakarta on Monday. He mentioned the reference to state loss considerations in Constitutional Court Decision Number 62/PUU-XI/2014, which stated that the finances of state-owned enterprises, including state finances, are indeed valid, but not sufficient as the sole basis for criminally charging someone. In addition, Tom Lembong was found guilty of violating Article 2 paragraph (1) of the Corruption Eradication Law juncto Article 55 of the Criminal Code. However, according to Hardjuno, there is a lack of in-depth argumentation regarding the proof of mens rea or malicious intent of Tom Lembong in the case. In modern criminal law, a person is punished when two elements are met, namely actus reus (wrongful act) and mens rea (malicious intent). ""If mens rea is not proven, the basis for sentencing becomes weak,"" he told Antara. Academic and constitutional law expert, Bivitri Susanti, highlighted the anomalies in the verdict received by Tom Lembong because there were no benefits enjoyed. ""The ones who benefited are people he doesn't even know personally,"" said Bivitri Susanti to Tempo on Monday, July 21, 2025. In the decision of the Corruption Court Panel of Judges in Jakarta, it was stated that Tom Lembong had no malicious intent and did not receive personal gain from the sugar import policy. Bivitri also questioned why the panel of judges still imposed a prison sentence on Tom Lembong. ""What was decided is truly a policy. Because it turned out in court that he did not have very technical authority,"" said Bivitri. Tom Lembong's Appeal Tom Lembong's legal advisor, Ari Yusuf Amir, stated that his client would file an appeal against the verdict imposed by the Panel of Judges. ""We will file an appeal on Tuesday. One day of punishment, Mr. Tom will appeal,"" said Ari to reporters in Jakarta on Monday. According to Ari, one thing to note regarding Tom Lembong's verdict is the lack of mens rea (malicious intent). He argued that the lack of detailed explanation regarding mens rea indicated anomalies, doubts, and uncertainties by the Panel of Judges in delivering the decision, so if considering the principle of in dubio pro reo, Tom Lembong should have been acquitted. This principle is a legal principle stating that if there is doubt in proving a criminal case, the doubt must be considered in favor of the defendant. In addition, another thing to note is the calculation of the Financial and Development Supervisory Agency (BPKP) because ultimately, the panel of judges calculated state financial losses, so all audit results were refuted. ""The panel's considerations also describe the potential loss, by considering the profits that should have been obtained by state-owned enterprises or PT PPI,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Attorney General's Office stated that the public prosecutor is currently considering whether to appeal the 4.5-year prison sentence for Tom Lembong. ""We declare that we will consider it within seven days while waiting for the complete copy of the panel of judges' decision,"" said the Head of the Legal Information Center at the Attorney General's Office, Anang Supriatna, in Jakarta, on Sunday. The spokesman also stated that the prosecutors respect the decision handed down by the panel of judges of the Central Jakarta Corruption Court.";
tempo;Devastating floods in South, Southeast Asia expose climate risks, systemic gaps;"Parts of South and Southeast Asia have witnessed the most devastating flooding in years as a result of relentless downpours compounded by a tropical cyclone, with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand reporting a combined death toll exceeding 1,400, with nearly 900 people still missing. It is believed that human-induced vulnerabilities have amplified the flood impact despite the heavy rainfalls, with experts appealing to strengthen early warning systems, shelter facilities, and disaster management plans. A rescuer walks through flood water to bring relief supplies for disaster-affected communities at a temporary shelter in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia on Nov. 29, 2025. (Photo by Saddam/Xinhua) HEAVY TOLL As of Wednesday, 770 people had died and 463 were missing from recent floods and landslides in North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Aceh provinces in Indonesia. In Sri Lanka, the death toll from adverse weather triggered by Cyclone Ditwah has risen to 479, with another 350 people missing, while more than 1.6 million people from 455,405 families have been affected nationwide. Thailand has experienced a heavy rainstorm unseen in centuries in its Hat Yai district in Songkhla province, with satellite images showing the district was once mostly submerged under 2 to 3 meters of floodwater. As of Tuesday, the floods had caused 180 deaths in the country, of which 142 were in Hat Yai. In Indonesia and Sri Lanka, washed-out roads and collapsed bridges have cut off remote villages, with bad weather worsening the situation. In Thailand, it is estimated that damage could reach around 40 billion baht (about 1.25 billion U.S. dollars). Asia is currently warming nearly twice as fast as the global average, fuelling more extreme weather and wreaking a heavy toll on the region's economies, ecosystems and societies, according to the World Meteorological Organization. This photo taken on Dec. 1, 2025 shows a flooded area in Colombo, Sri Lanka. (Photo by Gayan Sameera/Xinhua) RELIEF UNDERWAY Addressing the country on Sunday night, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appealed for international solidarity. Indonesian authorities also reported fuel shortages and limited transportation access that continue to hamper evacuation efforts. Aid is arriving from various sides to support the flood-hit countries that struggle to begin cleanup and reconstruction. The Asian Development Bank has approved a 3-million-U.S.-dollar disaster relief grant for Sri Lanka to support emergency operations. Chinese leaders have offered condolences over the disastrous flooding that hit the region. Upon Colombo's request, China has decided to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka, including a cash grant and supplies such as life jackets, tents, blankets and bed sheets. The Red Cross Society of China has provided emergency cash aid to the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, while Chinese businesses and community groups in Sri Lanka have also lent their helping hands. Meanwhile, Chinese community groups and enterprises in Thailand have mobilized funds and supplies for emergency response, with the Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce in Thailand delivering both relief goods and cash to affected areas. A man checks flood damages on a street in Hat Yai, Songkhla province, Thailand, Nov. 28, 2025. (Xinhua) SYSTEM ALARM SOUNDED Jazaul Ikhsan, lecturer in civil engineering at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta, said these floods, which occurred almost simultaneously, were the result of a combination of extreme weather and human intervention through maladaptive spatial planning. High rainfall was indeed the initial trigger, but damage to watersheds, inadequate drainage systems, and land use change exacerbated the impact. Several technical indicators show that flood control infrastructure is insufficient for current climate conditions, Ikhsan said. Hijrah Saputra, lecturer in disaster management at Indonesia's Airlangga University, noted that the early warning system has not reached remote villages, spatial planning is not yet disciplined, and environmental rehabilitation is still sporadic. ""If we want to reduce casualties in the future, then resilience must be built through spatial planning, watershed ecology, and regionally integrated early warning systems,"" he said. There was a lack of proper public training or guidance to help people understand how to carry out emergency plans, said Thailand's environmental and health expert Sonthi Kotchawat. Flood warnings were issued too late, a scientist from Thailand's Kasetsart University said in an article published in local media. ""Every November, provinces in the southern region of Thailand host a familiar clash ... What Thailand does not yet have is the bridge: from what scientists see in July to what district chiefs need by September,"" he wrote";
